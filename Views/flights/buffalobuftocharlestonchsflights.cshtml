            <h3>The perfect weather to Visit Charleston</h3>

            <p>If you have the chance to plan your visit in the middle of the Charleston spring, which is mid-April through the end of May, the weather will be relatively warm ranging between 60 and 90 degrees and the city will be filled with jasmine, an aromatic flower that loves to attach itself to Charleston's walls and fences. During the spring, people can enjoy the 'casual warmth' of the area alongside the architecture, local food, and gorgeous surroundings of Charleston. Nonetheless, tourists who want to travel when there are fewer people should not plan their trip during the spring and autumn. The weather is perfect during these times and people continue to flock to the Charleston coast to kick-off as well as close the beach season. The time when you will find the fewest visitors is right after Christmas and New Year's Eve.</p>


            <h3>Some Must-Visit Attractions</h3>

                <li>Folly Beach:  Folly Beach is rated one of the best beaches in South Carolina and this beach is a Barrier Island beach which is preferred by the locals because of the accessibility as this beach is located just within a drive away from Downtown Charleston. Still, Folly Beach, which is also called the Edge of America, has remained a relatively small and unspoiled beach.</li>
                <li>Kiawah Island Beach: Kiawah Island Beach is among the most stunning barrier islands in Southern Charleston and is equipped with more than ten miles of an immaculate shoreline.
