            <p>As of 2024, Delta Airlines hosts two main types of premium cabins. They are </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Domestic First Class.</li>
                <li>International Business Class, also known as Delta One. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>One of the primary reasons why premium cabins are not equal is because Delta comprises a massive fleet with some older aircraft. In 2016, Delta surprised the aviation industry by introducing the Delta One Suite. From then, it earned the title of the first airline to host an all-suite business class. It even exceeded Qatar with its QSuite.</p>

            <p>A large portion of Delta's fleet comprises two premium seats- First Class and Delta One. </p>

            <h5>Delta One</h5>
            <p>Delta One is a business class that offers flat-bed seats. They primarily serve long-haul international routes in addition to a few transcontinental domestic routes.</p>

            <h5>First Class </h5>
            <p>First Class is also known as a premium class, and it serves domestic and short-haul international flights. Unlike Delta One, the seats are not flatbed.</p>

            <h2>First Class VS Delta One</h2>

            <p>There is a huge difference when it comes to Delta's First Class and Delta One experiences. Not only do they differ from each other, but also between different aircraft. <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>FaresMatch booking</b></a> will help you fly in Delta business class for cheap.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>In Delta First Class, you are provided seats that are larger than the economy and Comfort+ seats. Moreover, this business class has extra legroom and deeper reclines. </li>
                <li>IHowever, you will not find them on the regional aircraft, the Bombardiers and Embraers. Here, the First Class seats are slightly larger than the Main Cabin seats. This is because of the small size of the aircraft. </li>
                <li>IYou will get Meal service only on flights longer than 900 miles. However, you will be given snacks and beverages.</li>
            </ul>


            <h5>Delta One benefits</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>In Delta One, you will get more spacious lie-flat seats, which come with extra storage. There are pre-departure beverages, well-served meals, and alcoholic beverages.</li>
                <li>IYou will be given an amenity kit with all sorts of toiletries, including noise-canceling headphones.  </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Price of Delta Business Class tickets</h2>
            <p>Similar to all airlines, the prices offered by Delta keep fluctuating, and it is highly dependent on routes, seasonality, and how advanced you are in making your booking.

If you choose FaresMatch as your flight finder, they will help you find a much cheaper flight for their loyal customers.</p>
