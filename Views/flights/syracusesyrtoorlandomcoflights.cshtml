            <h2>The best time to plan a visit to Orlando</h2>

            <p> February through May are usually the greatest months to visit Orlando because of the availability of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-orlando.aspx"><b>cheap flights to Orlando</b></a>, reduced crowds, cheaper lodging options, and ideal weather (particularly if you reside in a colder climate!). Orlando is a popular tourist destination because of its many theme parks and attractions, but going during the "off-season" might help you save money on entertainment and travel costs. Enjoy the great outdoors while the weather is clear, comfortable, and dry. </p>

            <p> Take a kayaking or paddle boarding lesson on one of the many lakes near Orlando, or visit Blue Spring State Park to witness the springtime migration of manatees.
