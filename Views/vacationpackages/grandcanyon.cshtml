                    <h2>Adventure Awaits on the North Rim</h2>
                    <p>Being less crowded and more remote, the North Rim provides you with a calmer, more splendid Grand Canyon experience. As it lies at a higher altitude & is covered with thick pine forests, the area is completely different in character from the South Rim. It's perfect for the natural world enthusiasts & the experienced walkers in this world, as the place harbours several beautiful locations, such as Bright Angel Point and Cape Royal.</p>
                    <p>The season lasts only two months, from the middle of May to the middle of October, during which there are fewer people and spectacular views drive the effort. A few travel deals may contain permissions for camping or taking a room in the lodge here. Simultaneously with wanting the off-the-beaten-path thrill, the North Rim position story tranquility and greatness but very few tourists are present that can be likened to a gift.</p>
