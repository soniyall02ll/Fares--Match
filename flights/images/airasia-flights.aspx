                <h1>Find Great Deals on Air Asia Flights Tickets Reservation Online:</h1>

                <h2 class="text-justify">History of AirAsia Airlines:</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">In 1994, Air Asia was founded, and on November 18, 1996, it commenced operations. DRB-Hicom, a government-owned corporation, launched the company. Former Time Warner executive Tony Fernandes' business Tune Air Sdn Bhd purchased the deeply indebted airline on December 2, 2001, for the token value of one ringgit (approximately USD 0.26 at the time), with debts totaling USD 11 million (MYR 40 million). Air Asia made its first international route to Bangkok from Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, in 2003. Presently, AirAsia has planned flights to over 165 destinations in 25 countries. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Where the Air Asia Airlines Headquarter Located? </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Being a Malaysian low-cost carrier, the headquarter is based in Kuala Lumpur. It is Malaysia's largest airline in terms of fleet size and destinations. Klia2, the low-cost carrier terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia, is the company's main base. Thai AirAsia, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippines AirAsia, and AirAsia India are some of the company's associate airlines.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">Fleet Size Served by AirAsia Airlines: </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">AirAsia is one of the world's fastest-growing low-cost airlines. AirAsia began operations in 2001 with just two obsolete planes and a staff of 250 people. Today, the airline serves over 88 destinations and carries over 220 million passengers. The airline now has approximately 150 Airbus A320s in service, with another 200 on order for the new A320s. While Airbus A320s have a capacity of 180 passengers, the Airbus A330 has a capacity of 377 passengers. So, AirAsia flights reservations are very easy to make. </p>
