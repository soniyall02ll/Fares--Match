                <h2>Your airline selection must be appropriate</h2>
                <p>Not all airlines right now offer the cheapest airfare tickets to passengers at the last minute, but there are a few airlines like Frontier, JetBlue, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/spirit-airlines-flights.aspx"><b>Spirit Airlines Flights</b></a> are prominent airlines that book last-minute flights. You can find highly cheap last-minute flights with all these airlines, but you still need to compare the fares.</p>
