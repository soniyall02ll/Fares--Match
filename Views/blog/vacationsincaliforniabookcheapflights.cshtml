            <p class="text-justify">California is a great place with a beautiful community and many tourist spots. There are resorts, beaches, and the sea. Most people visit California to have a wonderful time relaxing by the sea and partying at night. But <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/vacations-in-california-book-cheap-flights.aspx">flight tickets to California</a> can be pretty costly, and their availability can fluctuate based on season and time. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">But there's great news for travelers and tourists since Southwest Airlines have some great offers and deals on their <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-california.aspx">cheapest flights to California</a>. Now, tourists can book tickets to California round-trip for affordable prices only at <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-airlines.aspx">Southwest Airlines</a>. Summer is a great time to go to California and enjoy the ocean, and here are some wonderful tips to get your hands on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights.aspx">cheap flights</a>.</p>

            <h2>Timing plays a vital role</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Airplane tickets are available throughout the year, and tourists can obtain them whenever possible. But, it is vital to get the tickets when they are cheap and are available in abundance. When tickets are first released, they are in abundance, but their prices are high too. With time, around three months before the scheduled flight, the ticket prices fall to the lowest, and tourists should grab the tickets during this time. It is also advised not to book a flight at the 11th hour since there are frequent price hikes. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Also, during the last few days, the tickets booked will get seat allotments in odd places, and tourists who book them might have a bad flight experience. Hence, it is advised that the tickets be booked well before time. There are a few tricks that might help in getting good <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">flight deals</a>:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Try to book the flights on weekdays. On weekdays, the usual traffic of passengers is less since most of them are busy with their daily schedules. Hence, the number of tickets available and the price are also less. </li>
                <li>Look out for seasonal sales. During summer, there are a lot of sales that apply to flight tickets. The ticket prices are reduced quite a bit. </li>
                <li>When flying from outside the US, there is a proper window to book flight tickets at an affordable price. This window opens around three months before the scheduled flight. Hence tourists can use this window to book their favorite flights. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Choosing the right airlines</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Getting flight tickets at an affordable price depends a lot on the airlines chosen. Several airlines provide tickets at an affordable price, and tickets are refilled once they are sold out; hence tourists find it quite easy to access these tickets. For example, Southwest Airlines provides special offers on flights to California from Florida, and tourists can avail of these offers and travel easily. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Price of the tickets depends on the requirements of the passengers; if the main focus is on comfort and in-flight experience, the going for expensive airlines or tickets is the right move since those provide luxury like nothing else. But, for tourists who have saved most of the trip budget on the trip itself, finding an affordable flight is a must. Also, most airlines allow bookings from third-party sites where ticket prices often receive huge sales. Hence, tourists can check out these sites too. </p>

            <h3>Picking the baggage carefully</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Luggage is an important aspect of traveling; the less, the better. Tourists often make poor choices when selecting their luggage and pay a lot for the carry bags required to allow their luggage on the flight. Too much luggage often slows the journey and can become quite a burden for people traveling long distances. Here are a few reasons why packing only the essentials is a must: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>If the luggage is selected properly, it will reduce the number of items to be carried, and the overall costs since airlines charge passengers based on how many extra bags they carry. </li>
                <li>If the number of items to be carried is large, then packing them separately in bags is the better option since that would lead to better luggage organization. A better organization often means lesser bags, even if the luggage is more, thus reducing the costs. </li>
                <li>
                    Flight attendants often find it difficult to help passengers with bags that are too heavy. Hence, carrying lighter bags will improve the overall flight experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Loyalty programs often help</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Tourists are advised to sign up for any airline's loyalty programs and to stick to one airline of choice while traveling. The more they travel, the more points they collect on the loyalty program, which helps them unlock exciting offers and rewards. Some airlines feature miles-based loyalty programs where passengers gain miles when they travel on flights of that airline. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">These miles can later be converted into equivalent discounts on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">flight tickets, hotels, and vacation rentals</a>. Some airlines feature their credit card system wherein users get loyalty points whenever they make payments using credit cards. Overall, loyalty programs unlock brand-new ways of saving on flight tickets. </p>

            <h3>Going Incognito while searching</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Using the Incognito feature of web browsers often helps users in finding the right price for flight tickets: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Going incognito means the airline's websites can no longer track user data, meaning they cannot vary the prices of flights based on whether the user is going to buy a ticket. </li>
                <li>Incognito mode also does not save search history, meaning that the browser cannot provide suggestions to airline's websites on whether the user will buy a ticket. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-justify">Going incognito can make a huge difference when it comes to booking tickets. Another great tip is to use different accounts while accessing airlines. For example, tourists can use three different accounts to access tickets from three different airline websites, which would help them find tickets easily. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Summer is a time of joy and going out for vacations. People love summer and go on trips and trails to gather memories and make their summer even better. Many of these plans include packing their bags, taking photographs, making arrangements for staying at hotels, and finding proper airplane tickets. Tourists need a flight finder, and FaresMatch serves that purpose pretty well. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Tourists can now book a flight and compare fares according to their preferences. For example, they can check California flight ticket prices. FaresMatch makes booking a flight easy and affordable and is thus the best option for people searching for <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-flights-to-california.aspx">Southwest flights to California</a> and the US.</p>
