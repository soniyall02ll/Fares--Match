            <p>Tampa is a restless city that cannot be easily explained or confined. Some people only catch a glimpse of the Florida Aquarium or Busch Gardens before heading for a cruise, while others come to watch an MLB, NHL, or NFL match and run straight to the beaches. Tampa has a lot of things that one can do, starting with when you drop anchor in the Channelside District. Make Tampa your next destination by booking the cheapest <b>St. Louis to Tampa flights</b> on <b>Faresmatch</b>.</p>



            <h2>A three day Tour Plan of Tampa </h2>

            <p>Booking an <b>STL to Tampa roundtrip</b> flight can help you minimize your budget and explore Tampa in the best way. To do so, use this short tour plan provided by <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>FaresMatch</b></a>.</p>

            <p><b>Day 1:</b> Begin at Tampa Riverwalk to take a walk along the Hillsborough Riverpause for art at the Tampa Museum of Art and creativity at Glazer Children's Museum. This experience ends the day of touring around Ybor City which is considered to be the historic part of Tampa with dinner at a Cuban restaurant.</p>

            <p><b>Day 2:</b> Spend the morning at Clearwater Beach or St.Pete Beach. Go for paddle boarding or watch dolphins. Spend the day there sunbathing. Head back to Tampa for dinner at Armature Works food hall with multiple dining options.</p>

            <p><b>Day 3:</b> Busch Gardens will provide you with outstanding rides and animal experiences as well. Stop at ZooTampa at Lowry Park if you are looking for more fun for you and your family. The last activity will be a dinner sail in Tampa Bay.</p>


            <h3>When to visit Tampa?</h3>

            <p>The most favorable time to visit is between November and February. This also falls in the tourist season for Tampa making it perfect for visiting outdoor activities such as Busch Gardens, Clearwater Beach, and Tampa Riverwalk. However, for budget-relevant travelers, it can be cheaper at the time when the rainy season is not dominant and it is summer, which is from June to August, but in this season it is humid and storms in the afternoon can happen. Early fall has other advantages; firstly, there are not many tourists and secondly, the prices remain reasonable.</p>
