            <p>Chicago is a bucket-list city with its skyline, its rich culture, and, of course, its unbeatable food scene. This is worth considering: travel from Ontario, California, and here's how to do it – the most affordable, greatest guidebook, from the weekend to an extended stay.</p>
            <p>You will find all the budget options and expert insider advice you need to book smart here, from tips on how to snatch <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/last-minute-flights.aspx"><b>last minute flights</b></a> to maximising vacation packages via FaresMatch.</p>

            <h2>Architectural Splendour at Every Corner</h2>
            <p>Chicago is a veritable treasure trove of towering skyscrapers and historic buildings. Chicago has a unique identity, built by the skyline that includes these wonders. The architecture boat tours on the Chicago River allow for a beautiful way to take it all in.</p>
            <p>The open-air museum feel you get as you walk through The Loop with the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco flair gives Chicago a one-of-a-kind experience. You do not have to be an architecture expert to appreciate it; Chicago inspires all.</p>

            <h2>Foodie Paradise in the Windy City</h2>
            <p>The iconic deep-dish pizza of the city can be matched with any gourmet restaurant that has earned a Michelin star. Don't forget to sample street eats like Italian beef sandwiches and Garrett's popcorn.</p>
            <p>Then Pilsen, a neighbourhood in the city, would be your destination to have completely authentic Mexican flavours, or you might want to get to Chinatown for mouthwatering dim sum. Farmers markets and rooftop brunches also close the food adventure.</p>

            <h2>Immersive Culture in Museums and Music</h2>
            <p>Be it in the form of museums or music venues, the culture of Chicago offers an all-embracing experience for every taste. An example of great places that do this is the Art Institute of Chicago, where everything from Monet to Warhol is to be appreciated. For those curious minds, the Museum of Science and Industry is a must-see.</p>
            <p>Regarding music, it's found everywhere, from the blues clubs in Bronzeville to the downtown jazz lounges. Culture is never confined to indoors in Chicago; it winds itself through its streets, parks, and nightlife.</p>

            <h2>Enjoy the Enchanting Waterfront Side of Chicago</h2>
            <p>In Chicago, the Lakefront Trail is an ideal biking or walking track, affording one skyline views. Navy Pier is home to family fun, boat cruises, and seasonal fireworks.</p>
            <p>During the warm months, one can see the people flocking to beaches such as Oak Street Beach to bask in the sun. Add lakeside cafes and rentals for water sports, and the city combines natural beauty with urban excitement.</p>

            <h2>A Relaxed Starting Point For Big Adventure</h2>
            <p>Before your <b>flights to Chicago when you’re travelling from Ontario</b>, explore Ontario to the fullest. Ontario, California, isn't just a hub; it's also a destination in its own right. This mellow SoCal city combines suburban charms with some interesting cultural gems. Take a walk down historic Euclid Avenue to one of the local cafes for a bit of refreshment, or visit the Ontario Museum of History & Art to discover the roots of this area.</p>
            <p>For more adventurous people, there are scenic hikes available in the San Gabriel Mountains, which are just a few kilometres away. Nature, community, and modernity are present in just the right proportion to begin a journey to Chicago.</p>

            <h2>Tricks on Booking for a Budget Traveller</h2>

Use the Southwest Low Fare Calendar or look up on FaresMatch to compare deals. Booking in advance usually saves more, but for the spontaneous, you might still score lucky with a last-minute flight.</p>
