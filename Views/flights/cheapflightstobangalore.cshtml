            <h3>Best Time to Visit Bangalore</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The weather in Bangalore makes it favourable for visitation any period, but significantly from October to February would be recommended. Within this timeline, the temperatures are relatively low and conducive for touring activities. </li>
