            <p>Atlanta is the biggest city in the United States. Are you thinking of planning your next vacation in Atlanta? If yes, then you must know everything about this airport, and it can be helpful for you to look at the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/atlanta-airport.aspx"><b>Atlanta airport</b></a> map. This map is mainly available on the official website and the airport application. There is a section of the map on the official website where you can find everything about this airport, including a map, parking, facilities, and more. ATL.COM is the official website of Atlanta International Airport. </p>
            <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is consistently ranked as one of the world’s busiest airports. Navigating ATL is not an easy thing without using the map. </p>
            <H2>1. The Core Layout: Domestic & International Terminals and Concourses</H2>
            <p>As per the Atlanta airport map, it is divided into two main areas. First is the domestic terminal, which is the largest of the two and handles the vast number of flights within the United States. It is also divided into north and south sections for airline check-ins and baggage claims. On the other hand, the international terminal is the Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal (Concourse F), which handles most international arrivals and departures. </p>
            <H2>2. The Concourses (A, B, C, D, E, F, T) </H2>
            <p>There are seven concourses connected to the main terminals. Concourse T is the first concourse you use after security in a domestic terminal. On the other hand, Concourses A, B, C, D, and E are extended eastward from the domestic terminal and connected by the plane Train. There is another Concourse F, which is the International Terminal itself, located at the far eastern end of the concourse system. </p>
            <H2>Key things to know about concourses: </H2>
            <p>Gates are according to the concourse: Gate A15 is in Concourse A, and Gate F08 is in Concourse F. When it comes to knowing about the airline's presence, then we can say that <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Delta Airlines</b></a> has a massive presence across most concourses, and other airlines typically operate from particular areas. Non-delta airlines often use the North Domestic Terminal and Concourses T, C, and D. Don’t worry about the services because each concourse has its own selection of restaurants, shops, restrooms, and amenities. </p>
            <H2>3. Getting Around: The Plane, Train & Pedestrian Walkways</H2>
            <p>One of the most essential elements that you need to know when navigating ATL is the plane train. This is an underground automated people mover or APM; this train runs 24/7 and connects all seven concourses (T, A, B, C, D, E, F) with the Domestic and International Terminals. </p>
            <H3>Underground Automated People Mover</H3>
            <p>This train also runs 24/7 and connects all seven. In terms of efficiency, it is the quickest and most popular way to get between concourses, with trains departing approximately every two minutes. The entire end-to-end journey takes less than 5 minutes. The Plane Train is fully accessible, with elevators and escalators at each stop. </p>
            <H2>Pedestrian Walkways: </H2>
            <p>It is also an option to go anywhere and parallel to the Plane Train, and if you have more time or prefer to walk, then there are pedestrian walkways running parallel to the Plane Train on the same level. You can also use the moving sidewalks, and these walkways often feature moving sidewalks to help speed up your journey. </p>
