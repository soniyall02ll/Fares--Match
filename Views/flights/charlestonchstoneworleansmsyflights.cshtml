            <h2>Getting to the City That Dances to Its Own Beat</h2>
            <p>New Orleans will animate all senses through music, rhythm, and energy. As soon as you land in this city, it entraps you in jazz, colour, and culture. Music is much beyond bars, for it spills on museums, parades, and historic performances.</p>
            <p>Be it Mardi Gras or just a swing in the French Quarter, New Orleans promises a beat you will never forget.</p>

            <h2>Culinary Adventures in the Crescent City</h2>
            <p>Creole and Cajun cooking dominate here – gumbo and jambalaya, crawfish etouffee and beignets bedecked with powdered sugar. Renowned dives, high-end dining, and scrappy pop-ups all unite in showcasing the bold flavours derived from the mixture of cultural roots.</p>
            <p>New Orleans dining is less about eating and more about diving deep into this city’s rich heritage and its very soul.</p>

            <h2>Historic French Quarter</h2>
            <p>Whenever you go inside the French Quarter, it is like going back in time. It is a treasure that holds iron-laced balconies, and Creole townhouses painted with vibrant colours. The aroma of fresh beignets wafts through the air, with local artists painting the town.</p>
            <p>Be sure not to miss Royal Street's antique shops and art galleries, and take a contemplative pause inside St Louis Cathedral. Morning walks and late-night jazz play out the New Orleans charm in every detail.</p>

            <h2>Explore Garden District</h2>
            <p>If you want to escape the party mood of the French Quarter, Garden District is the place to go to get that grace and get pure serenity. Grand mansions, shaded oak-lined streets and historic cemeteries-- this totally opposite side of New Orleans is brought to life through the lens of the Garden District.</p>
            <p>It's a great blend of Southern wow with old-world charm for the architecture and slower-paced explorers.</p>

            <h2>Marine Beauty with Timeless Grace</h2>
            <p>Charleston marries history and grace with a seaside calm that is difficult to resist. With cobbled streets jutting out into pastel-hued homes, strolls take you back hundreds of years through horse-drawn carriages down the French Quarter. You will find everything from Lowcountry shrimp and grits to world-class fine dining along this city’s culinary spectrum.</p>
            <p>Waterfront panoramas flanked by centuries-old edifices and fine old hospitality make the place quite filmy. Be it a weekend or a leg of a lifetime, this charming city is the gateway to fostering fresh adventures further.</p>

            <p>Hunting for the best <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-flights.aspx"><b>cheap flights</b></a>?

            <p>Months out or even hoping for last-minute deals, you will find browsing through more than one airline captures value within a good bargain.</p>

            <h2>Booking Last-Minute Deals with Vacation Tools</h2>

            <p>Travellers can maximise the savings in both convenience and value with a vacation bundle – pairing an aeroplane with savings on hotels and experiences.</p>
