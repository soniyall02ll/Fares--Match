            <h2>When to book flights from San Diego to Seattle? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Planning a trip to Seattle, often known as the Emerald City, is a thrilling possibility. You're at the right spot, though; when is the ideal time to visit Seattle? October and September are the ideal months to visit Seattle. Winter's bitter cold can discourage even the most ardent tourists, but summer is the city's high season when accommodation rates soar and availability declines. Nonetheless, early autumn is a great time to visit because the summer heat lasts until the crowds thin out, offering many hotel rooms at discounted prices. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Fall brings brilliant foliage and cool air to Seattle. The parks and trees of the city come alive with a stunning fusion of red, orange, and yellow colors. Even if the weather starts to cool off, now is a perfect time to go on adventures outside. Meanwhile, spring brings warmer temperatures and less expensive lodging; you should expect rain and chilly winds. Just remember to bring the right clothing to fend against blustery gusts and the apparently constant drizzle. </p>
