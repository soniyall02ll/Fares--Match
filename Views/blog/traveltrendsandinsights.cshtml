                <h3>2. Sustainability Takes Center Stage</h3>
                <p>Eco-conscious travel is now a trend; airlines focus on green initiatives, offer more fuel-efficient flights, and allow flyers to offset their carbon footprints directly during booking.</p>
                <h3>3. Flexible Booking Options</h3>
                <p>According to current travel trends, flexible booking options are very trendy. Because of airline and travel company flexibility policies, people have more freedom for free cancellation, changes, and other modifications in tickets.</p>
                <h3>4. Multi-Destination Bookings</h3>
                <p>With travel becoming more affordable, multi-city itineraries are trending. Many travellers are combining leisure and work trips, taking advantage of extended stopovers offered by airlines.</p>
                <h3>5. Rise of Subscription Services</h3>
                <p>Right now, one more popular trend is flight subscription plans. These plans offer many perks to the passengers, such as the ability to choose a set number of flights per year or a flat fee, and they are gaining users' attention.</p>

                <h3>1. Use Fare Alerts</h3>
                <p>Sign up for notifications from flight search engines and apps. These tools will keep you informed of any last-minute price drops.</p>

                <h3>4. Look for Hidden-City Tickets</h3>
                <p>While not without risks, booking a flight with a layover in your final destination (and skipping the last leg) can sometimes be cheaper.</p>
                <h3>5. Monitor Airline Social Media</h3>
