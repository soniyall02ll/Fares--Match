                                <li><b>Compare rates on Delta's official website and on flight search engines: </b>It is easier to pick a cheaper deal for your travel when you compare the rates. Make sure you analyze the website thoroughly, as mentioned in the first part of the blog. </li>
                                <li><b>Try to bag promo codes: </b>Yes, airlines offer additional promo codes for the customers. Therefore, before you book a delta flight ticket, try to bag promo codes to purchase delta flight tickets on sale.

Therefore, try to follow delta airline on each social media platform. It will help you analyze the deals and offers provided by the airline to the customers. </li>
                                <li><b>Try to book in advance: </b>If you work far from your hometown, you would want to join your family on Christmas or Easter. Flight ticket booking rates during such occasions are usually higher. You either pay the higher price or cancel your plans. Well, not anymore. For such events, you may pre-book your flights and save a lot. Pre-booking always helps even if you have to book the flight for a cousin's wedding as the rates are cheaper. </li>
                                <li><b>Student's discount: </b>If you are a student under 26 years of age, you can claim a student's discount for a low-cost flight from delta airline. </li>
