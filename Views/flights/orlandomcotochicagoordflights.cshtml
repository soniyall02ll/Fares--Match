            <p class="text-justify">Chicago is located on the banks of Lake Michigan in the United States of America. Where it had once been the home of Potawatomi, in the mid-eighteenth century, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable settled in the area and started the first nonindigenous settlement of the region. It grew splendidly throughout the nineteenth century as a part of the newly freed country. The first setback to the city came in 1871 in the form of an event that would come to be known as the Great Chicago Fire. Despite great suffering and destruction, the city recovered and continued its progress. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The Chicago River is an exciting tourist spot throughout the city. Unlike the name suggests, it is not a single river but a system of multiple rivers, lakes, and canals. The credit for building this unique waterway goes partly to man and partly to nature. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Another spot of interest in this city is the Art Institute of Chicago, a major art museum of the nation. The city, known as a transport hub, is famous for its Chicago “L” train system. Built almost a century ago, the Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain is a well-known spot in the city. This fountain, built in the beaux-arts style of architecture, reminds visitors of a luminous wedding cake.
