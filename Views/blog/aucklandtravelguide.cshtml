            <p class="text-justify">Auckland is one of the majestic cities in New Zealand. The city is surrounded by water which defines its sparkling appeal. The magnificent harbour of the town is reminiscent of other famous waterside cities and has its unique charm. The city has a rich maritime history which shapes its identity as a seafaring city. </p>

            <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">Airlines reservations to Auckland</a> are the
            <p class="text-justify">only expensive thing. However, you can get deals and discounts on the tickets. As the condition is stable now, Auckland travel restrictions have been removed. Below are some things you must know before making your plan for Auckland. </p>

            <h2>Best time to visit Auckland</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">The best time to visit Auckland is during the summer season of New Zealand, ideally between December and the beginning of March. Auckland's natural beauty is more appealing during summers, and all outdoor activities are best experienced when it is sunny and warm. You can also enjoy and explore many music and art festivals during summertime. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Some festivals are Wonder Garden, St. Jerome's Laneway Festival, and Splore. Every year in January, Auckland's version of Wimbledon takes place at the ASB Classic tennis tournament. The months mentioned above offer pleasant temperatures, mostly sunny days and thin tourist crowds. Hence you can explore Auckland to the fullest. </p>

            <h3>Some things to know before visiting Auckland</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Auckland is one of the largest cities in New Zealand where urban life and natural splendour intersect. You can walk around the central business district and explore the city. But the best way to properly investigate the town is by car as they are pretty spread out and public transport can be indirect and consume a lot of time. You must visit Newmarket, Ponsonby, Parnell and Takapuna on the North Shore, which is worth your visit. You can also find some beautiful beaches, fantastic cafes and boutiques which will surely entertain you. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Here you will find locals who are very friendly and always willing to help the travellers by providing them with directions. Auckland is also one of the world's most liveable cities. The city is also considered very safe as the crime rate here is meagre.
            <p class="text-justify">Hence you do not need to worry if you are a solo traveller. Tipping is generally not the norm in New Zealand. Some travellers might opt to add gratuity when they are dining out. </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Currency used and Accepted: NZD</li>
                <li>Language Spoken: English</li>
                <li>Calling Code: +64</li>
                <li>Capital City: Auckland</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="text-justify">These are some basic things to know while making your trip to Auckland. </p>

            <h4>How to get around the city</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Here are some ways you can get around and explore the city</p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Trains </h2>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Ferries </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Fullers and Sealink operate from downtown Auckland and provide routes to places like Devonport, Waiheke Island, Rangitoto, Hobsonville Point and Half Moon Bay. Ferries are one of the most scenic ways to travel around the city. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Car apps </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">In Auckland, Uber and Ola are the main and the most used car apps. Both the apps offer the customers comparable pricing. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Visit Matakana</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Matakana is Auckland's version of Napa Valley, dotted with vineyards and rustic al fresco. It would be best if you visited Brick Bay, a sculpture trail with contemporary installations spread throughout a serene bush path. </p>
