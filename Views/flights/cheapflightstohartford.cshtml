            <h3>Best time to fly</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">The spring and autumn seasons in Hartford are pleasant, so visiting in April and May, or in October, maybe great. Autumn, on the other hand, may outshine spring since it allows visitors to witness the spectacular New England leaf-fall in action. Summer is warm but not oppressive; however, festivities such as River fest can draw large crowds. If you want to save money on lodging, go in the winter, but keep in mind that Connecticut is cold in the winter. </p>
