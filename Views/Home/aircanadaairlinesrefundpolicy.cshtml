            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">If you booked your <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">flight tickets</a> using Air Canada's official website or a third-party website or an agent, you can only cancel through the same point of contact. The amount of the refund will be determined by the ticket restrictions.

            <h3>Frequently asked question</h3>

            <h3 class="text-justify">How can I cancel my flight ticket with Air Canada Airlines Refund Policy?</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">To cancel the flight ticket with Air Canada Airlines, both online and offline options are available for flight cancellations. You can cancel your reservation using the official website, or call the Air Canada customer service phone. </p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">When can I request a refund? When can I expect it? </h3>

            <p class="text-justify">Remember to request a refund through your original payment method because every partner has a booking system that we don't have access to and they are better qualified to help you. Within 24 hours of purchase, all tickets may be canceled and fully reimbursed. </p>
            <p>The reimbursement takes 1 to 3 months to process when the withdrawal request is granted. Refunds will be done using the same payment method. </p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">Can I ask for compensation if my flight gets delayed by 2 hours? </h3>

            <p class="text-justify">If the airline is responsible for the cancellation or the replacement flight delays your arrival by 2 or more hours then you are legally entitled to compensation. </p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">How to check if my flight is refundable? </h3>

            <p class="text-justify">There are situations when we need to postpone a ticket but also wish to return to avoid any inconvenience. Latitude, Business Flexible, Premium Economy Flexible, and refundable tickets are eligible for a full refund. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">However, according to Air Canada's flight cancellation policy, you must cancel your ticket before the departure of your trip. Within 7 business days of canceling, your refund will be applied to your original mode of payment. </p>

            <h3 class="text-justify">What is the best way to see if my airline is refundable? </h3>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Read all of the terms and conditions in the refund section of the Air Canada airline service to see if it offers a full refund or a partial refund. If the airlines give partial refunds, you might look for full refundable flight tickets.
