            <p>Puerto Rico is amongst the most beautiful places on earth with its beaches, culture, and history, and travellers can dream about spending an unforgettable vacation there. The whole journey <b>from Cleveland to Puerto Rico</b> is an amalgamation of basking under the sun and an exciting adventure.</p>
            <p>When you book through FaresMatch, flights and hotels can be very low-priced, giving you the best from the island getaway.</p>

            <h2>How to Explore Puerto Rico?</h2>
            <p>Puerto Rico is heaven for all who love nature - whether they want to explore or just adventure-thriller in action: the island makes available a variety of landscapes and outdoor experiences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter rainforests like El Yunque, where one can find waterfalls and hiking trails, or volcanic caves found in the earth. Go through tree canopy zip-lining, shred world-class Rincon waves, or dive in clear waters with colourful coral. </li>
                <li>The other draws of Puerto Rico are its glimmering bioluminescent bays, such as Mosquito Bay, in which an enchanting glow captures all attention after sundown, making it perfect for a kayak trip. </li>
                <li>Rugged mountains form this Caribbean island, complemented by very beautiful pristine beaches and a rich biodiversity. </li>
                <li>Puerto Rico is certainly not for everyone; aside from hiking, it is a treasure and holiday for a person who prefers kayaking and snorkelling over getting pampered on a sunbed with stunning scenery.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Serious Culinary and Nightlife Adventure</h3>
            <p>Puerto Rico is a culinary paradise, viewing the strong Spanish, African, and Taino influence in its cuisine.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You hear about the most delicious mofongo: a dish prepared fresh from mashed plantains and stuffed with enticing ingredients including garlic, shrimp, or pork. </li>
                <li>Another recommended traditional island offer is its lechon, the whole roasted pig that you will discover at a handful of roadside eateries, tender, meaty, and bursting with the island’s taste. </li>
                <li>For dessert, bring home a rich treat of flan, a soft custard best to complement the horchata or the Puerto Rican coffee.</li>
                <li>As if not enough in terms of food, Puerto Rico’s nightlife is also dreamy and varied. It has a little something for everyone—from the salsa dancing enthusiast to the listener of a live band to someone who cools it with cocktails while staring out over the ocean. </li>
                <li>Stylish bars, rooftop lounges, and night spots can easily be found in the capital city of San Juan. </li>
                <li>Ponce or Rincon are probably a little slower and allow you to enjoy the island’s local music and drink rum in the sun of a beach-casual environment.</li>
            </ul>
