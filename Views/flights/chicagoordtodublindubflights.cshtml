            <h3>When to visit the destinations?</h3>
            <p> The correct time to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>book flight tickets</b></a> (e.g., JetBlue airlines tickets)to Dublin from Chicago is during the late spring, May through early June, or early fall, September through October. Such periods are characterized by good weather, low rainfall, less crowding, and active nightlife. The end of spring is the best time to visit Dublin since you will be welcomed by the smell of blossoming flowers and longer days for strolling through parks and gardens. </p>

            <p> Many people prefer to visit in early autumn because the climate is still good for outdoor activities such as sightseeing and day trips, although crowds are thinner. Due to many festivals and warm temperatures, July to August is also preferred but is rather crowded and expensive. </p>
