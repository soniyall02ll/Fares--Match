                <h3>Trakai Castle</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">This winter vacation, you can also head to Lithuania in winter to see Trakai Castle situated on its own islet and surrounded by a frozen lake just west of Vilnius. The castle dates back to the 1400s, and you can see a dramatic turret and a drawbridge, making it all more enchanting. The lake is frozen solid, so you can take some time out for ice skating. Do not miss an adrenaline rush at the ice block-art sailing and cross it off your bucket list in Trakai. </p>
