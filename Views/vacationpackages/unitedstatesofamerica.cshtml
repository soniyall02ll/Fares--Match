                <p>
                    The United States has so many diverse destinations, from coastlines to big cities, that it's hard to
                    say which places deserve America's best. It has considered various factors, including
                    accommodations, dining options, and surveys of thousands of travelers, to determine the best places
                    to visit in America. Tourists always spend more money in the United States than in any other
                    country. And it also attracts the third most tourists behind France and Spain. It may be explained
                    by accommodation.
                </p>
                <h2>Things to do in the United States of America</h2>
                <p>Below is a list of things you can do in the United States of America. </p>
                <p><b>Head to wildlife watching</b></p>
                <p>
                    The landscape of America is inhibited by an array of wildlife, many of which are protected as
                    national parks and other reserves. Some of the destinations to visit are Yellowstone, Glacier, and
                    other Rocky Mountain parks. If you are interested in marine life, American coastal waters, including
                    orcas around Washington's San Juan Islands and humpbacks, dolphins and other whales in
                    Massachusetts, Florida, California, Hawaii and Alaska, are great places.
                </p>
                <p><b>Climb a mountain</b></p>
                <p>
                    Every tourist visiting America must at least see a majestic mountain once in their lifetime. Mount
                    Whitney in the Sierra Nevada, the Half Dome at <b>Yosemite National Park</b> and Mount Washington in
                    New Hampshire are some breathtakingly beautiful mountains where you must plan a trek.
                </p>
                <p><b>Drive through Route 65</b></p>
                <p>
                    Undoubtedly, no road in the entire world is as iconic as America's great lost highway, Route 66. The
                    street is more than 2000 miles long, from <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-illinois.aspx">
                        Illinois to
                        California
                    </a>. Taking a drive over Route 65 is going to be worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>Best Places to visit on a trip to the US </h2>
                <p>If you miss the following destinations on your trip to America, you will miss significant fun. </p>
                <p><b>San Francisco</b></p>
                <p>
                    The charming and picturesque West Coast city of San Francisco is an ideal getaway destination for
                    couples, singles, or families. You will explore famous sites, charming streets, beautiful views, and
                    outdoor dining here. All these features are something that makes San Francisco such a great place to
                    visit.
                </p>
                <p><b>The Grand Canyon</b></p>
                <p>
                    The <b>Grand Canyon</b> is one of every tourist's must-see, bucket-list destinations. This majestic
                    site has been attracting visitors for generations. Nothing is as beautiful as gazing out over the
                    canyon walls to an endless horizon and an unfathomable depth making it one of the highlights of any
                    trip to the United States.
                </p>
                <p><b>Waikiki</b></p>
                <p>
                    Waikiki is among America's top beaching destinations. All the comforts of <b>North America</b> are
                    bestowed on this beautiful tropical island in the Pacific Ocean. A suburb of Honolulu, Waikiki is
                    famous for the beautiful golden sand beach stretching along the oceanfront. You will quickly get
