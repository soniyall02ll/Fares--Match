                <p class="text-justify">Looking for a place to celebrate Easter peacefully and joyfully? Easter falls in the spring, and spring is by far the best time to plan a trip. Spring means long days, warm weather and nature are more beautiful than ever. Easter offers enough time to take the family away for a few days, or even more than a long weekend. People love traveling at Easter for many reasons including celebration and for getting <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">Easter Flights Booking Offers</a>. They also adore traveling during Easter because it is one of the best opportunities to get to know the traditions and customs of the destinations we visit. It is one of the favorite times to travel but while planning, it gets difficult to choose a perfect US destination. This is why we at FaresMatch have decided to compile a list of the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/top-10-us-destinations-to-book-easter-flights-2023.aspx">best Easter destinations</a> around the US. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">New Orleans</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">New Orleans is popular for its jazz, architecture, cuisine, Creole, and Cajun cultures, and Mardi Gras festivities. Given that Easter is Mardi Gras' opposite, it should come as no surprise that New Orleans is among the best venues to observe this occasion. The first Easter parade starts early in the morning and travels through the French Quarter to St. Louis Cathedral. There Easter Mass is held, obviously, it's a must to see. Furthermore, the Chris Owens French Quarter Easter Parade in the early afternoon features traditional bead throwing and entertainment. Lastly, the Gay Easter Parade later in the day brings the day's events to a close. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">St. Louis</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Spending your Easter holidays in St. Louis, Missouri, and the neighborhood is a fantastic idea. If you enjoy baseball, you should also check out the St. Louis Carnival Busch Stadium. In addition to hosting baseball games, Busch Stadium also features a Hall of Fame, museum, and stadium tours. Visit one of the Augusta Wine Trail wineries for excellent wine before leaving town. Or stop by the Anheuser-Busch Biergarten for a variety of interesting brews. You may avail the best <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">Easter Day Flights</a> to the St. Louis location by grabbing a seat today through FaresMatch. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">Miami</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Miami is ideal all year long due to its nice climate, gorgeous beaches, and vibrant beach huts. It is best visited in the spring, which makes it one of the greatest locations to visit for Easter. You can find numerous real Cuban restaurants, art galleries, and parks in Little Havana. It offers a glimpse into the Cuban culture in Miami. The Everglades National Park is also worthwhile to visit, and from your airboat, you may observe the park's abundant crocodiles. So if nothing else comes to your mind, choosing Miami could make your Easter time bright. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">Savannah</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Spending a long weekend in Savannah, Georgia, in search of a nice American city to visit for Easter? Savannah, which sits on Georgia's coast, is a historic city with a lot of interesting landmarks. At Easter, Savannah's April temperatures are in the 70s, and springtime flowers and foliage are starting to bloom. You could spend the day exploring the lovely Historic District, where you'll find many lovely residences, churches, and public spaces. Or make your way to Forsyth Park to see the stunning fountain that is commonly included in Savannah pictures. Finally, take a nocturnal ghost tour because Savannah is reputed to be one of the most haunted cities in the US.
                </p>


                <h2 class="text-justify">Waco</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Booking an <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airline-tickets.aspx">airline ticket</a> to Waco is also a smart choice to celebrate Easter day. Waco in Central Texas is a creative city with a small-town feel, so consider going there for Easter. The temperature range in April is between 55 and 75 degrees, making it ideal for springtime activities. If you're itching to raise a glass on Easter Sunday, Barnett's Public House in Waco holds an annual Easter Keg Hunt. Adult participants will hunt for the golden keg in downtown Waco and then have supper at the bar. Enjoy Cameron Park's pleasant springtime weather by having a picnic there or taking a stroll along one of the many riverfront trails. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">Palm Springs</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Easter in Palm Springs is a great choice because the temperature is warm but not oppressively so! The typical temperature is 89 degrees, which is ideal for enjoying the sun, nature, and the pool at your hotel. The best outdoor activity in Palm Springs is biking. You can either rent a bike or ask your hotel if they have any bicycles you can use. If you're looking for excitement, this can be a good option for you. Given that Palm Springs is in a desert, you can only imagine the amount of open space there is for off-roading. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">Big Sur</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Consider Big Sur in California as a destination if you're seeking Easter holiday options in the US!

                <h2 class="text-justify">Cannon Beach</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">If you're planning a road trip along the coast, an exciting hiking trip, or a leisurely beach holiday, Cannon Beach, is a fantastic destination. Visiting Cannon Beach in the spring will give you the chance to explore the beach and the town effortlessly. While summers are gorgeous, they are also incredibly popular. For this reason, it's one of the best Easter vacation ideas in the US. Check out the beach and neighboring trails while you're at Cannon Beach! You may also see special artifacts, works of art, and photographs at the no-cost Cannon Beach History Center. </p>



                <h2 class="text-justify">Mystic</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Mystic is a peaceful seaside community with a strong maritime history on the Connecticut coast. You may reach Mystic in 2 hours by automobile from Boston and New York City. This makes it a simple day excursion or a pleasant pit break on a New England road trip. Go to the Oyster Club for Easter brunch if you're looking for delicious New England seafood. They serve wonderful food that is available locally. The Barley Head Brewery is nearby, and if microbreweries are more your style, there are many of them in the downtown area with beer on tap.

With world-class attractions, quiet green areas, delicious cuisine from throughout the world, and Easter celebrations, you'll never get bored!
