                            <p class="text-justify">
                                Blue crab is what most people think when anyone mentions Maryland’s food.

                            <p class="text-justify">Maryland is considered in the south, so it shouldn’t be surprised it has its barbecue style. Unlike most countries, which call for cooking fatty meat for hours, Maryland’s regional barbecue is made from lean top toast beef that’s minimally seasoned and barely cooked on a grill directly above hot charcoals. The raw to medium-rare pink meat is thinly sliced and is often piled atop a roll with onions and a sauce. </p>

It is also known as striped bass in other parts of the country; in Maryland, it is called rockfish because they like to hide in nooks and crannies of reefs and ledges. The buttery white flesh is medium to firm and has a mild flavor, i.e. little sweet and salty. You can find it prepared in various ways in many restaurants across the state, from grilled toasted to steam. </p>

The cake with vanilla cookies is hand-dipped in fudge icing, giving it a thick and chocolaty cap. Today these are available in every store in Maryland, and it is one of the most delicious cookies. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-justify">Lake Trout</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">It is made from whiting caught in the Atlantic Ocean, and lake trout are covered in crushed crackers or cornmeal. It is fried until crunchy and golden and served hot atop a slice of white bread. Hot sauce can be optional. In and around Baltimore, restaurants called Lake trout, Lake trout 2, and Lake trout 3 are all excellent places to try this food. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Maryland is the 5th most densely populated state in the USA. There are many tourist spots in this state, and many tourists come here to spend their vacations. There are many places to watch, such as museums, antique sculptures, and monuments. It is known for its blue crabs and the city of Baltimore, a significant historic trading sport and basketball power. The environment and the climate are favorable to live in. </p>
