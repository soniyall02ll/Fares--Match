                    <h2>Cheap Hotels in New York</h2>
                    <p>It is optional to introduce The Big Apple. Before you even arrive in the city, you will have seen depictions of its boulevards, skyscrapers, and sparkling Times Square in motion pictures. Finding the New York City of your dreams is relatively easy. However, choosing a place to live might take a lot of work because this city comprises many different neighborhoods, from Brooklyn's trendy Williamsburg to Manhattan's historically bohemian West Village. </p>

                    <p>Not only is New York not frequently recommended as a cheap travel destination, but lodging can quickly eat up a sizable portion of your trip budget. It is possible to locate cheap hotels nearby by using Faresmatch. </p>

            <h2>Cheap time to visit Los Angeles</h2>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, the winter—roughly any time between January 4th (about) and the first half of March—is the most affordable time of year to book a hotel through <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>Faresmatch booking</b></a> in New York City. New York's Low Season lasts only a few months, from January to March, when the city is firmly under the grip of winter. The city regularly sees more snowstorms due to climate change, yet it never stops! It's a great time to find low-cost deals on travel and lodging and Broadway plays. The best benefit of all is that there are fewer tourists visiting museums and other attractions. </p>
