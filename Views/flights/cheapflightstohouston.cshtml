            <p class="text-justify">Houston is the biggest city in Texas. It's a busy metropolis that draws people from all over the state and nearby places.

These are just a few of the things that make it a good place to visit. Also, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/frontier-airlines.aspx"><b>Frontier Flights</b></a> make planning the perfect vacation in Texas easier than ever for people who want to see the best of Houston's offers. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Airlines offer special prices and deals on tickets to popular places like Houston when travel isn't as busy as it is during peak travel times. These flight tickets are cheaper than when most people are traveling. This is especially true when there aren't as many tourists as at other times of the year. As you are planning your trip, keep an eye out for these deals whenever they come up. If you use FaresMatch as your travel partner, it will be very easy to find flights to Houston at prices that you can afford. People can choose the most affordable vacation dates by comparing the prices of different airlines, such as Frontier Flights, known for being very cheap. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Some of the best places to visit in Houston are the Space Center Houston, the Museum District (which has the Houston Museum of Natural Science, the Museum of Fine Arts, and other museums), the Theater District, and downtown Houston's lively food and drinks scene.
