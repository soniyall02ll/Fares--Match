                    <p class="text-justify">The United Kingdom, officially known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is one of the most important and influential countries on the globe. Although it is separated from the European Continent by the English Channel, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Celtic Sea, and the Irish Sea, it wields considerable influence in European politics. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The nation consists mostly of islands that are part of the British Isles archipelago, with a single land border with the Republic of Ireland. Foremost among the individual areas that form the United Kingdom are Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England. The nation has existed for multiple centuries, making it one of the oldest and most famous countries in the world. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The nation was once home to primarily the Celtic people before the arrival of Romans, who conquered the land after multiple invasions. After the slow decay of the Roman Empire, Germanic Anglo-Saxons settled in what is now known as England, with Gaelic people and Picts retreating to the area presently known as Scotland. After this, the following significant change in the nation’s history was the arrival of the Normans. The Normans, who hailed from the Duchy of Normandy in France, set up a new ruling class and a new system of governance. Much of the culture of the land, including its language, has been a direct result of this invasion, which led to the occupation of England, large parts of Ireland and Wales, and finally, the unification of Scottish and English crowns. </p>
