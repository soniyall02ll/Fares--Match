                            <p>Starting as the Italian national airline in 1946, the airline was named Alitalia. Also somewhat well known regarding routes that connect Italy with several global cities, it represented Italian civil aviation and passion. Alitalia's problems with funds and transformations were many over the years. However, one attempt was made to consolidate some of these operations to address the volatility of the prices, and this venture closed shop in October 2021. It was succeeded by Italia Transport Aereo (ITA Airways), which was specifically forged to offer air transportation service only but under a new name.</p>

                    <h2>Hidden gems in Alitalia</h2>
                    <p>As an airline, Alitalia has no fixed addresses, but it does fly to several of Italy's most famous and popular locations. Here are some hidden gems in popular Italian cities and regions that Alitalia would commonly serve. Below is a list of lesser-known destinations that are in the most traveled cities/regions in Italy and, therefore places Alitalia would naturally frequent:</p>
                    <h3>Rome</h3>
                    <p>Quartiere Coppedè: A mystical community where mythical and unconventional forms of construction are depicted across the area. It is rather more akin to a suburb – one of the least touristy areas in the city if one thinks about it.</p>
                    <h3>Milan</h3>
                    <p>Vigna di Leonardo: It was a vineyard that Leonardo da Vinci once or never owned, located in the middle of Milan. It is a relatively unknown history center, but I recommend visiting to learn more about the man's life and history, specifically Florence.</p>
                    <h3>Florence</h3>
                    <p>Giardino Bardini: This is a garden of four hectares in size. This is a place with a vegetable garden as well as a fruit orchard.</p>
                    <h3>Venice</h3>
                    <p>San Giorgio Maggiore: It is a small island. It is way less crowded up there and the view is great, it is worth it to climb up (or pay for the water taxi).</p>
                    <h3>Naples</h3>
                    <p>Gaiola Island: The island is said to be uninhabited and located close to Naples. There is the Gaiola Underwater Park and it must be said that it has wonderful snorkelling waters but it has quite the tale to tell too.</p>
                    <h3>Sicily (Palermo)</h3>
                    <p>Catacombe dei Cappuccini: One of the peculiar tours is tombs buried underground, where one can see thousands of mummified people.</p>
                    <h3>Perugia</h3>
                    <p>Rocca Paolina: This is a place where, nowadays, visitors can wander through its spooky corridors and chambers, which have become an unusual section of the city’s walkways.</p>
                    <p>Oratorio di San Bernardino: This tiny chapel boasts an elaborate Renaissance front showcasing beautiful carvings by the renowned artist Agostino di Duccio. It’s a peaceful, off-the-beaten-path spot that displays exceptional workmanship.</p>
                    <h3>Matera</h3>
                    <p>It is not as well-known as Rome or Venice, but it is a destination that will provide an incredible experience for anyone looking for something different and off the radar. This city is one of the longest continually inhabited places on earth, and its Sassi districts are cave-like dwellings carved into the mountainside dating back thousands of years.</p>

                    <h3>Tropea</h3>
                    <p>Tropea lies in the southern Italian region of Calabria and is known for its gorgeous beaches, pristine translucent waters, and unique medieval charm. The old town is a labyrinth of narrow streets, cozy squares, and ancient buildings, providing an authentic Italian experience without the throngs of tourists you would find at the most popular Italian hotspots.</p>
                    <h3>Trieste</h3>
                    <p>Trieste’s architecture reflects the city’s fascinating history, from magnificent Habsburg-era palazzi and Roman ruins to a wealth of faded grandeur. At its center, Piazza Unità d’Italia is Europe’s largest seafront square, ringed by stately palaces and offering fabulous views of the Adriatic. Above the town, the historic Castello di Miramare is a 19th-century castle dramatically located on a clifftop overlooking the sea – the former residence of Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian.</p>

                    <p>The above-mentioned sites are amongst the best off-the-beaten-track sites, and they are much closer to the real feel of the various parts of Italy.
