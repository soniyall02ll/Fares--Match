            <h2>Los Angeles: The City Is Calling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Los Angeles is a glitzy, glamorous synonym for unlimited discoverability at the Hollywood International Airport. Opportunities galore—you could check out Hollywood, with its famous Walk of Fame and the TCL Chinese Theatre. Or climb up to the Hollywood Sign and take in an amazing panoramic view of the city.</li>
                <li>If you enjoy a sun-soaked beach, then check out the Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach with bustling boardwalks, street performers, and the tantalising taste of local food. Keep in mind to visit the Getty Centre, an architectural wonder in itself, which houses world-class art collections.</li>
                <li>Travelling with kids? Bring them over to Universal Studios Hollywood, where they offer a variety of thrilling rides and immersive entertainment. Cultural landmarks, like the LA Cultural Museum of Arts (LACMA), share space beside the hustle and bustle of downtown LA because Los Angeles indeed has everything.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Phoenix: A Jewel of the Desert with Unique Adventures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On your way to Los Angeles, find enjoyment around Phoenix, with much to offer for breathtaking desert land views and what seems an imaginative cultural heritage that begins your day with a sunrise hike at Piestewa Peak. The scenic rise is soothing from the city’s bustle.</li>
                <li>Art aficionados will find an excellent array of contemporary and classical art at the Phoenix Art Museum. Or perhaps you favour something more natural: South Mountain Park and Preserve promises great hikes, bike riding, and simply enjoying more of the unspoiled Sonoran Desert.</li>
                <li>As if that wasn’t enough, though, foodies will find an exciting food scene in Phoenix. Heavily known, therefore, still on tacos and Sonoran hot dogs at some of the city’s top hangouts. It’s just a wonderful place to start the road that leads to Los Angeles—add easy-going and warm hospitality.</li>
