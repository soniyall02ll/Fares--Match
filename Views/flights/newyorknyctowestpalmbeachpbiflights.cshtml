            <h2>Choose your travel dates and destination</h2>

E.g.:- <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/jetblue-airlines-flights.aspx"><b>JetBlue airlines reservations</b></a>.</p>
            <p><b>Compare prices</b></p>
            <p>Check various airlines and time of flights for the same route and their prices. Think about the layover time, travel time, or any other expenses that the traveler will have to meet. </p>
            <p><b>Select a flight</b></p>
            <p>Select the flight that can afford you and matches your shopping schedule. Be sensitive to the baggage policies and the prospects of seat choices. </p>
            <p><b>Book your flight</b></p>
            <p>Finalize your booking by entering your personal details and payment information. Always read all the sections before agreeing to purchase a product. </p>
            <p><b>Receive confirmation</b></p>
            <p>When your booking is done you will get a confirmation email with your itinerary and e-ticket. Remember to use this information to check-in.</p>

            <h2>Tour plan</h2>

            <p>Take an extraordinary flight from New York to West Palm Beach – a city rich in beach culture, art, and other recreational activities. You can use this tour plan as a guideline for the impressive five days you are going to spend.</p>
            <p><b>Day 1: The Arrival in West Palm Beach </b></p>
            <p><b>Morning:</b> Take a flight to Palm Beach located either in JFK or La Guardia airport in New York city and then take a road trip to Palm beach international airport (PBI). The flight commonly lasts about 3 hours.</p>
            <p><b>Evening:</b> Head to a fine dining restaurant with a view of the water such as E. R. Bradley’s Saloon and then go for a walk to Clematis Street.</p>


            <p><b>Day 2: Spare Some Time to Visit West Palm Beach </b></p>
            <p><b>Morning:</b> Recommended places to see the masterpieces like the Norton Museum of Art, where you can look at the American, European, and Chinese art pieces.</p>
            <p><b>Evening:</b> Go to Avocado Grill restaurant for a nice selection of fresh meals, local ingredients, and the atmosphere of popular places.</p>


            <p><b>Day 3: Sun, Sea, and Shopping </b></p>
            <p><b>Morning:</b> Go to Palm Beach and spend the day on the beach basking in the sun or surfing. Take a bicycle and you will be able to cover the trail commonly referred to as Lake Trail.</p>
            <p><b>Evening:</b> There is also a possibility to have dinner at Buccan – a quite popular and rather elegant bistro where guests are served rather unique dishes.</p>


            <p><b>Day 4: Outdoor Adventures </b></p>

            <p><b>Day 5: Departure </b></p>

            <p><b>Afternoon:</b> Go back to your hotel and/or check out, then proceed to the airport for your flight back to New York.</p>

            <h2>When to visit?</h2>
            <p>Usually, it is during the later summer and early fall because this is the season where airfare from New York to West Palm Beach is at its lowest. However, the prices for flights and hotels are lower during this time because it is somewhat off-season for travel, while the weather is hot with some humidity and occasional showers. </p>
            <p>Booking your flights and your car in advance and traveling mid-week on Tuesday or Wednesday are other effective ways of saving money. By using low-fare calendars, travelers can also have another way of saving money. Do not go during December and January because this is a busy month with high demands from tourists moving to warmer areas. </p>
