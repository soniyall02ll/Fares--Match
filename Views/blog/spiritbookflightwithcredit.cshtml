                <p>Spirit Airlines is one of the most well-known airlines in the United States of America. The airline owes much of its popularity to its successful employment of the low-cost model. The low-cost model has recently become a popular means of travel for all travellers who wish for greater autonomy and cheaper rates through the application of optional additional charges.</p>

                <p>Spirit Airlines has been serving its customers for thirty-seven years since it was founded in the year 1983 under the name Charter One Airlines and commenced operations two years later in the year 1990. The airline changed its name on 29th May of the year 1992 to its current one and since then has operated as Spirit Airlines.</p>

                <h2>Booking Flights is now Easier</h2>

                <p>The process of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>flight ticket booking</b></a> used to be complicated and cumbersome as travellers were required to buy their tickets at the airport. This led to long lines and delays in getting the tickets. This was solved by the advent of the process of online reservation of tickets through the official website of the airlines.</p>

                <p>The official website of airlines allows travellers to make reservations and changes in their schedule or destination for booked flights and cancellations. While all services remain subject to the policies and regulations of the airlines, this new approach helps travellers greatly as it is aimed towards making transactions easier and more efficient.</p>

                <p>The aim of Spirit Airlines has always been to prioritise the comfort, security and satisfaction of its customers. Therefore, the official website of the airline, Spirit Airlines streamlines and simplifies the processes to cater to the needs of the customers. Another option is to avail the services of special travel websites and apps to book flight tickets.</p>

                <p>Travellers can easily book flights by simply entering the location they intend to leave from and their destination. In addition to this, travellers might need to enter the total number of tickets that they will need to purchase for their trip. Travellers also need to specify if they wish to use any coupons or avail of special discounts.</p>

                <h2>Booking Spirit Flights with Credit</h2>

                <p>Reservation credit is a special tool offered by Spirit Airlines which allows travellers to save a significant amount of money when they make reservations on flights through the website of the airlines. This facility can also be used by travellers for other expenses such as covering fees for seats and bags and also extends to taxes.</p>

                <p>This tool is especially useful for travellers who are reserving seats on last-minute flights as this helps reduce the cost of these tickets significantly. The tool requires the use of the Reservation Credit number which is a six-character alphanumeric code and travellers need to enter it at the website while making the reservation.</p>
