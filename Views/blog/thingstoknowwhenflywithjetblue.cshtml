                <h2 class="text-justify">1). Tag of Low-Cost Airlines But Services Are Premium: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">JetBlue is one of those airlines that have the tag of the ultra-low-cost airline but when we talk about the services and privileges offered by this airline then we can say that these things are equal to Delta and American Airlines. Thus, it is not an ultra-low-cost flag carrier but only in terms of costing and no in terms of services. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">There are also so many other ultra-low-cost airlines such as Southwest and Allegiant but when we compare the services of these airlines with JetBlue we can say that this airline is getting countless positives reviews and comments in comparison to other airlines. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">2). Robust Network in the Eastern US and Caribbean: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Many flyers are thinking that JetBlue also has a large network such as Delta or United but the reality is airline operates a strong network in the Easter U.S and the Caribbean. You can also book flights to Mexico and Central/South America. Many International flag carriers are the partner of JetBlue Air such as Tap Air Portugal, Emirates, AZUL, AER LINGUS, and ICELANDAIR. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">4). Three Main Hubs Are in the United States: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">When we talk about the primary hubs of the JetBlue Airlines Flights, then we can say that there are three main hubs of the airline in the United States such as Boston, New York, and Fort Lauderdale. Focus Cities of the flag carrier are Long Beach, San Juan, and Orlando. If you want to go northeast to the Caribbean then this is the right airline for you but when you want to go the western half of the US then this airline is not an appropriate option for you. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Flying for the hubs and the focus cities is the right idea for the flyers when they are thinking to book cheap tickets for the holiday time. You can also enjoy the lowest airfare discount with the JetBlue Flights when you visit the JetBlue Airlines Reservations Official Site for the booking goals. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">5). Information about Blue Basic of JetBlue Airlines: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">JetBlue Airlines also introduce the Basic Economy fare with the name “Blue Basic” in 2019. Maybe you are thinking that in the basic economy fare, standard carry-on bags are not included but that’s not true. In this fare of JetBlue Reservations, a carry-on bag, and one personal item is also included. However, with the Blue Basic, you may face restrictions on boarding order, seating, cancellation, and change flexibility. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">6). JetBlue Never Denied for Boarding: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Many passengers are worried about the oversold flight situation. JetBlue only sells tickets as per the number of seats in a plan. Many other airlines overbook flights due to the no-show policy but JetBlue never does this and that’s why you will never face the situation of boarding denied in JetBlue. Boarding information can also be fetched through the JetBlue Official Site. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">7). True Blue-Pool Your Points to Anyone: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">One more advantage that passengers can avail themselves of while flying with JetBlue Airlines is to pool your points with anyone if you are a member of True Blue. Many airlines also allow for pool points with family members but in JetBlue, you have an opportunity to pool points with friends, roommates, and strangers as well. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">8). How to Book JetBlue Cheap Flights? </h2>

                <h2 class="text-justify">11). 24 Hours to Cancel or Change Tickets for Free: </h2>
