            <p>Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, mostly known by its abbreviation KLM, is one of the most well-known and important airlines of the Kingdom of Netherlands or Netherlands. The name of the Dutch royal carrier translates to the Royal Aviation Company. However, it is often known as the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines when referred to in English.</p>

            <p>The airline was founded over a century ago, a hundred and four years to be precise on 7th October in the year 1919. The airline has since become the oldest among all airlines in the world to continue operating to the present day. The headquarters of the airline is located in the Amstelveen city municipality in the country of the Netherlands.</p>

            <p>KLM provides multiple flights to a total of hundred and sixty-three destinations in seventy countries spanning five of the major continents of the world including domestic locations. The hub of the airlines is located in the Amsterdam Airport Schipol, located at a distance of nine kilometres or five point six miles to the southwest of the city of Amsterdam from which most <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/klm-airlines.aspx"><b>KLM Airlines flights</b></a> are made available.</p>

            <h2>Frequent Flyer Programs</h2>

            <p>Frequent flyer programs are a popular tool used by many airlines to boost revenue through the promotion of customer revenue. A frequent flyer program is a special kind of loyalty program, specifically applicable to airlines and allows travellers special benefits under certain conditions.</p>

            <p>Travellers who are eligible for participation in frequent flyer programs need to be, as the name suggests, frequent customers of the airlines. They are capable of earning special benefits such as reduced prices for their flight tickets, seats located adjacent to their fellow travellers and boarding priority and special merchandise.</p>

            <p>While the exact privileges available vary from airline to airline, all of them universally attempt to better the situation of travellers who have remained loyal to the company by offering them perks and rewards. In some programs, points earned through travelling miles on the airlines can be transferred or gifted to other travellers.</p>

            <h2>Booking KLM Flights</h2>

            <p>Making reservations has become an extremely easy process over the years negating the need to visit the ticket counters of the airlines at airports. This is mostly due to the advent of online booking processes available from the official website of the airlines which saves a lot of time and effort which would otherwise have been wasted on travelling to the physical locations.</p>

            <p>KLM too has an official online website which allows its customers to make a reservation, change a previously made reservation to fit with their new schedule or even cancel a reservation. To make any reservation on KLM flights or get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-deals.aspx"><b>flight deals</b></a>, passengers only need to enter the location they intend to leave from and their intended destination.</p>
