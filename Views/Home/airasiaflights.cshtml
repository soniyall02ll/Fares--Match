                <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        In 1994, Air Asia was founded, and on November 18, 1996, it commenced operations. DRB-Hicom,
                        a government-owned corporation, launched the company. Former Time Warner executive Tony
                        Fernandes' business Tune Air Sdn Bhd purchased the deeply indebted airline on December 2,
                        2001, for the token value of one ringgit (approximately USD 0.26 at the time), with debts
                        totaling USD 11 million (MYR 40 million). Air Asia made its first international route to
                        Bangkok from Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, in 2003. Presently,
                        AirAsia has planned flights to over 165 destinations in 25 countries.
