                <h3>Print Your Air France Boarding Pass </h3>
                <p>If you don’t know the meaning of a boarding pass, then we can say that it is an airline document that is provided to the passenger. This pass grants permission to a passenger to board an aeroplane for a particular aircraft or flight. Boarding passes define the identification of the passenger, flight number, date, and scheduled time for departure. Generally, airlines accept paper or electronic boarding passes. </p>
                <h2>Air France Airport Check-in</h2>
                <p>The second most popular way for passengers to check in is at the airport's staffed check-in counter. A flyer must have their passport, flight information, a paper ticket, or an e-ticket with a confirmation number. You can also check the email you receive when booking tickets online or offline through the travel agency. Now, show the printed itinerary with a confirmation number. </p>
                <h3>In-person at the airport using a self-check-in kiosk</h3>
                <p>You can also use the kiosk to print boarding passes. Kiosk machines are available at almost all airports in the world to print the boarding pass. You need to select the seat, enter the number of bags (in the condition of checked baggage), and print the boarding pass. That’s sit! It’s enough to complete the Air France check-in process. Next, you need to carry your luggage and hand it over to the Air France staff counter or the airline's checked luggage station. The airline may also examine your passport either at the time of check-in or boarding at your gate. </p>
                <h4>What do you need for Air France kiosk check-in? </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confirmation number</li>
                    <li>Credit Card used during the payment of the ticket</li>
                    <li>Passport</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Online check-in before arriving at the airport</h2>
                <p>Savvy passengers always choose the online check, which can be done 24 hours before the departure. You can check the luggage at the staff counter or the checked luggage station once you arrive at the airport, but you can complete the check-in process 24 hours before your journey. </p>
                <h3>Know the advantages. </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passengers who select the online check-in can avoid the big lines at the airport. </li>
                    <li>You can print your boarding pass at home and don’t wait in the lines of the self-service kiosk. </li>
                    <li>You can select the seat before choosing others. </li>

                    <li>Be updated with the check-in and boarding timelines. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Air France check-in deadlines</h2>
                <p>Generally, the deadline is between 60 minutes and 30 minutes before boarding. It depends on the type of flight and type of journey, whether domestic or international. Air France's check-in time deadline allows the flag carrier to load the luggage onto the plane at the right time and complete the documentation for take-off. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Air France international flight check-in deadline – 45 minutes to 1 hour</li>
