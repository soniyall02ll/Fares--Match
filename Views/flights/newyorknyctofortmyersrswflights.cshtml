            <p>Summer is the greatest season to visit Florida beaches if you want a peaceful escape by the sea and don't mind a little heat, humidity, and afternoon showers. October through March are the finest months to visit Florida if you want to witness a throng of travelers and beachgoers. The pleasant deep-winter weather makes December through February the months that beachgoers can't avoid visiting. </p>

            <p>Although hotel prices are on the rise, they remain more reasonable than those of other Florida tourist spots. The best months to schedule your beach vacation in Fort Myers are March through May if you don't mind larger crowds. The peak season is over, but hurricane season is still ahead. If you reserve your holiday package a few months in advance, you can take advantage of beautiful 80-degree temps as well as a lower price.</p>
