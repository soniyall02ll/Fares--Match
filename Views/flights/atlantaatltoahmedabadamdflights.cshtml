            <h2>Delve into Heritage and Architecture</h2>
            <p>The old city of Ahmedabad is a magnificent area, both ancient and contemporary, where for centuries, the arts were displayed and mixed in narrow lanes and historical buildings.</p>
            <p>Prominent examples of Indo-Islamic architecture are the Jama Masjid, built in the 15th century, and the Sidi Saiyyed Mosque with its stone latticework windows. Going through these streets is a feeling to traversing a living museum, where history blends with the present.</p>

            <h2>Visit the Sabarmati Ashram and Gandhi's Legacy</h2>
            <p>The Sabarmati Ashram is a historical site, which gives an insight into the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi, displaying several of his personal belongings, photographs, and letters.

            <p>Dress in traditional garb, and perform energetic garbas until late at night with the rest of Ahmedabad at Uttarayan (the Kite Festival), where one finds families competing on rooftops in flying colourful kites during the month of January. Travelling to the place during the festival season is a magical experience, exploring Gujarati culture.</p>
