            <p class="text-justify">Due to its scenic beauty and unique location, the island of Antigua, part of Antigua and Barbuda country, attracts visitors worldwide. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The country depends mainly on tourism as its primary source of income. The island has been promoted as a luxurious and leisurely beach retreat for decades to encourage tourism. Other significant contributors to the national economy include the education and banking sectors. Recently, the controversial venture of online gambling has also added to the country’s fortune. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The island had once been the home of the Guanahatabey people, later the Arawaks, followed by the Caribs. With the arrival of white settlers, the predominance of indigenous people was significantly reduced. While the first European to visit the island was a part of a Spanish expedition, the British were the first to set up permanent settlements on the island. Political murders, colonialism, and previously unknown diseases wiped off large parts of the indigenous population, making them more vulnerable. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The sugar cane industry of the island was primarily sustained through the exploitation of local and African enslaved people. Finally, the country won its independence from colonial rule and became an un-associated part of the British Commonwealth in 1981. To get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-flights.aspx"><b>cheap flight tickets</b></a> to Antigua, travellers should get tickets early to avoid any last-minute rushes, which might result in bad deals. Travelers can also aim to visit the island during the low season from May to November, when the island receives few visitors. </p>
            <h2>When to Book Flights from Vancouver to Antigua? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">The best time to get Vancouver to Antigua flights is now, as prices are lower than usual. The early part of the year is generally the best time to visit the island. The first four months of the year are mild and dry, allowing tourists to go sightseeing and partake in other activities such as strolls along the beautiful beaches. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Other than January, February, March, and April, May and June are good times to visit the island. The warm weather makes the beach even more enjoyable, and summer sports also gain popularity during this time. Since the latter part of the year finds the island experiencing devastating hurricanes, most people try to visit the country within the first half. </p>
