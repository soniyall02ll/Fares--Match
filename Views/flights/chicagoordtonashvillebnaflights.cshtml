            <h2>When to book flights?</h2>
            <p> The best time to get flights from Nashville to Chicago is during the spring season, which ranges from the beginning of March to the middle of May, while the other is the fall, which ranges from September up to November. The spring season comes with moderate weather that is best for visiting some parks like Centennial Park as well as engaging in festivals like the Nashville Cherry Blossom Festival. </p>
            <p> The autumn or fall season in Tennessee comes with cool and dry weather that is good for touring around in a car in places like the Natchez Trace Parkway to watch the fall foliage. Skipping the summer is also effective for escaping the hot and humid climate of Nashville, which is not favorable for travel, sightseeing, and other outdoor activities. If visiting during the winter, be ready for fewer crowds and lower temperatures when choosing winter clothes. </p>
