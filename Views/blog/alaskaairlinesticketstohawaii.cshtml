                <p><b>Baggage Allowance</b>: In first class, you can check in two bags for free. In other courses, you usually only get a carry-on.</p>
                <p><b>Boarding</b>: First-class passengers board first and get off the plane first. You’ll enjoy faster check-in and quicker security checks at some airports.</p>
                <p><b>Seats</b>: Alaska’s first-class seats have more legroom than any other U.S. airline (except for those with lay-flat seats). They have footrests, tablet holders, and cupholders and can recline for comfort with up to 41 inches of space. Plus, you’ll have a dedicated flight attendant.</p>
                <p><b>Lounge Access</b>: When you fly first class, you can access Alaska lounges for free. These are in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York-JFK, Portland, and Anchorage. You can also use partner lounges like the American Airlines Admirals Club. Lounges offer food, drinks (including cocktails), fast Wi-Fi, comfy seating, and concierge services.</p>

                <p><b>Food and Beverages</b>: On flights longer than 670 miles, you’ll get meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, including vegetarian options and alcohol. You can even pre-order your meal online or through the Alaska app.</p>
                <h2>Alaska Airlines: Business Class vs. First Class (Hawaii Vacations)</h2>
                <p>Alaska Airlines flights to Hawaii don’t have a business class. Instead, you can choose from these fare options:</p>
                <p>First Class</p>
                <p>Premium Class</p>
                <p>Main Cabin</p>
                <p>Saver Fare (Basic Economy)</p>
                <p>Let’s compare Alaska Airlines' Premium Class to First Class.</p>
                <h3>First Class Benefits:</h3>
                <p>Free food and drinks</p>
                <p>A dedicated flight attendant</p>
                <p>Access to lounges at the airport</p>
                <p>Two free checked bags</p>
                <h4>Seat Comfort</h4>
                <p>First Class seats have up to 41 inches of legroom, while Premium Class seats have 35-36 inches.</p>
                <h4>Premium Class Benefits</h4>
                <p>Premium Class passengers get some perks, too, like:</p>
                <p>Complimentary beer, wine, and cocktails</p>
                <p>Extra legroom compared to Main Cabin</p>
                <p>Choice of seat</p>
                <p>A free carry-on</p>
                <p>Early boarding and deplaning</p>
                <h4>Lounge Access</h4>
                <p>All First-Class tickets purchased with cash or miles include access to Alaska Airlines lounges. However, if you were upgraded to First Class, you won’t get lounge access. Currently, there are eight lounges, mainly on the West Coast, with one at NY-JFK. Alaska is upgrading its Seattle and Portland lounges, expected to finish by summer 2022. If you’re in Seattle, check out the new lounges at Concourse C or the North Satellite—they're modern and spacious. As part of Oneworld, First Class passengers can access over 620 Oneworld lounges around the world.</p>
                <h3>Book with Miles</h3>
                <p>A great option is for flights between 1,401 and 2,100 miles, starting at 25,000 miles each way—this is the same as trips between 701 and 1,400 miles so that you can cover more distance for the exact miles.</p>
                <p>However, some flights may require up to 70,000 miles based on availability and route popularity. Always compare the miles needed with the cash price to see if it's a good deal. As a rule of thumb, if you get more than 1.3 cents per mile, it’s a good value. If not, you might want to save your miles for another time.</p>
