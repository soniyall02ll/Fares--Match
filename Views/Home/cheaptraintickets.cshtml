            <h3>Additional Ways to Save on Train Tickets </h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Pre-purchase your rail tickets : </b>Making reservations in advance is one of the simplest methods to save money on train tickets. The price of your tickets will decrease the earlier you purchase them. It's a good idea to purchase your tickets as soon as possible if you know when you intend to go, as train companies often offer their tickets up to 12 weeks in advance.</li>
                <li><b>When it comes to your travel schedule, be adaptable : </b>Generally speaking, off-peak tickets are less expensive than peak-time tickets since they are available outside of the busiest hours of the day. Additionally, some train companies provide lower tickets for travel at specific periods of the day, including late at night or early in the morning.</li>
                <li><b>Consider alternative routes : </b>If you're not in a hurry to go there, it's worth investigating whether using a slower service may end up saving you money instead of choosing the straight route, which makes a lot of sense but may also cost more than taking a detour. For as little as an additional 20 or 30 minutes of travel, you may save a substantial amount of money.</li>
                <li><b>Verify first-class costs : </b>Operators sometimes offer first-class tickets at prices that are the same as or less expensive than regular fares. This is especially likely to occur if there aren't many first-class tickets available, which drops the price of those tickets significantly and lets you travel in luxury for less money.</li>
            </ol>
