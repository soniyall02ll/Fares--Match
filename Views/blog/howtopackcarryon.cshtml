                <h2 class="text-justify">1). Use Your Shoe Space for Essential: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">It may quite weird for you, but that's really important to pack your luggage as the carryon and not the checked bag. When you don't want to carry-shoes and have a replacement option to place in your shoe space of the bag, you can use this place to add a medication, undergarments, socks, and you're charging equipment as well. Don't think that your items will be messy because you can use the plastic bags to add these items and then place them on the shoes. You must understand the importance of utilizing space. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">2). Wrap Your Accessory in Plastic Bags: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">You can't do the packing of your bag with different stuff in one place. It would help if you used plastic wrap to make sure all the items differentiate from each other in one bag, such as your jewelry first. The plastic wrap works as the security for your stuff through which you don't need to worry about the complications in your baggage for the valuable items. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">3). Size of Bag Matters a Lot: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">In the excitement of vacations, don't pack lots of stuff because the size of the bag matters a lot. You need to maintain the carryon luggage size appropriately to avoid the situation when your luggage is not settled in the overhead bin due to the large capacity stuff. For this, you can also measure your bag's size and read the carryon luggage policy of your airline. In the procedure, you can get information about the weight and size limit. For example, if you are traveling in Alaska, visit the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/alaska-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Alaska Airlines Official Site</b></a> to check the carryon luggage policy. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">4). Check the List of What You Can Take In-Flight: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Be smart and always check the list of what you can take in-flight. Many items are not allowed in flight, and that's why passengers face the critical situation at the security check gate. Thus, they need to check the stuff which is prohibited in the flight. Generally, weapons, sports equipment, and lithium batters are not allowed. Traveling with <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Delta Airlines Flights</b></a> means you can get the list of prohibited items directly at the delta website. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">5). Understand the Difference between Necessary and Unnecessary Items: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Don't think that all the stuff you use in your regular life is essential for your vacation. It would help if you needed to understand the difference between necessary and unnecessary items. Filter the mandatory stuff for your journey, and you can't leave it in any circumstances. This will help you filter out the required things only for the carry-on baggage and save yourself from the checked baggage fee. </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">6). Folding Clothes Vs. Rolling Clothes: </h3>
