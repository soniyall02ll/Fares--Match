                            <p>The main connection between Korean Air and Delta Airlines is that both of them are Sky Team Alliance members. Delta is one of the founding members of this Alliance. As both of these airlines are a part of this alliance their miles can be used interchangeably provided there are some policies to adhere to. This miles-sharing feature is very beneficial for flyers who fly in airlines that are a part of this alliance. Especially for flyers flying from Korea to the US and vice versa for them booking flights have been a much more beneficial task. Korean Air and Delta Airlines also have a joint venture partnership over transpacific routes. This venture has offered an enhanced and much more expanded route for both the airlines equally. This connection has been favorable for both the airlines and the flyers who frequent these two airlines. </p>

                            <h2>Conditions to transfer miles</h2>
                            <p>Just because these two airlines are members of the Skyteam Alliance does not mean you can easily transfer miles. There are procedures and policies related to it. You can use a huge accumulated mile to book yourself free travel even a roundtrip. To put it into an example if you have say 25k Korean Air miles that can be used to get yourself a free roundtrip <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Delta Airlines Booking</b></a> to Hawaii from mainland US and back. </p>
                            <p>Now you can say that you are using your Korean Air Miles as Delta SkyMiles. The interface to choose to transfer your miles is through Korean Airpass.

You are strongly advised to read all the transfer policy-related statements before booking your flight using miles. You can read them through the Airline's website or even their customer service. Also, remember that sky miles are pretty difficult to earn. </p>
