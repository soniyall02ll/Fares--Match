                </p>
                <h2>California and its incomparable beauty </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">To spend a relaxing summer vacation, one must visit California if they are planning an international tour. Before planning, make sure that you must consider several factors, including affordability, weather and various things to do. Some places in California are a must-visit in the summer. The list of those places includes </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sequoia National park, </li>
                    <li>Lake Tahoe, </li>
                    <li>Mendocino Coast, </li>
                    <li>Mono County, etc</li>
                    <li>Paso Robles Wine Country</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sequoia National Park</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Sequoia National park is excellent for travelers seeking a National Park getaway. What makes it more beautiful in the summer is its feature of being much less crowded than Yosemite, which remains packed to the max during this time of year. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">You can visit Sequoia anytime; it can be the best place to visit with family but only in the summers. During this season, one can drive away all the way down into the Kings Canyon, which is by some measures assumed to be the deepest canyon in North America. </p>


                <h3>Lake Tahoe</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">It is one of the unique places to enjoy in the summer. The view of Lake Tahoe looks wide from a nearby mountain surrounded by lush green trees. The moderate daytime temperatures and cool nights make Lake Tahoe a perfect summer refuge, a place where one can go after they get a break from the Central Valley heat or perhaps the coastal summer fog. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Apart from the scenic beauty, there are several adventure activities in and around the lake when it's warm. Hiking trails abound, and the ski resorts adapt their facilities to indulge in summer activities like mountain biking, scenic tram rides, and gondola rides. Almost all roads will always be open, and as a passenger, one need not worry about snow chains and whiteouts. </p>

                <h3>Mendocino Coast</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Mendocino Coast is their place if travelers are big photo enthusiasts and love wildflowers. The Mendocino Coast experiences a wildflower season that comes later than it does in other bits and parts of California. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Summer blossoms that bloom early, especially the gawdy rhododendron that makes bushes out of its growth, add up to another level of the scenic coastline and make it even more attractive. It is so beautifully located in northern California that when Tourists visit this place, they experience its most comfortable temperatures in the summer. </p>

                <h3>Mono County </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">This area of California, located east of the Sierras along US Highway 395, is extraordinarily scenic and uncrowned at any time of year. But the perk one gets when visiting in the summer is the mountain passes that remain open. It, therefore, gets easier to get there from NorCal locations. </p>

                <h3>Paso Robles Wine Country</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">To avoid the summer crowds in Napa and Sonoma, try out a lesser-known, less crowded wine region in California. If you plan a trip to California, keep Paso Robles on your list; which is the centre of an excellent and growing wine region that's not yet overcrowded. </p>
