            <h2>Best Time to Book Flights to Alabama</h2>

            <p>
                The best time to get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>cheap flights</b></a> to Alabama is
                during the cool winter season. While the weather remains relatively mild this season, frequent
                rainfall makes it unpopular among travellers. As a result, special deals and offers on flight
                tickets and hotel accommodations are offered as businesses scramble to attract more travellers to
                the state.
