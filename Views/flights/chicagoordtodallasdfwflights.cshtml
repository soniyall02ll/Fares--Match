            <h3>Visit Dallas at the Perfect time</h3>

            <p> The best times to visit Dallas and Fort Worth are in the spring (March-May) or fall (September–November), when the weather is milder and more conducive to some of the best events, such as the State Fair of Texas in October and the Deep Ellum Arts Festival in April. You can safely explore the city on foot or by bicycle during these months without running the risk of heat stroke.  </p>

            <p> Summertime temperatures can reach triple digits, making it difficult to justify going outside. Spend a little extra on a classy hotel with an indoor pool and a breezy bar if you're stuck in Dallas at this time. Winter weather may be unexpected, bringing with it flash floods and ice storms that could wreck your well-laid plans. However, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>flight tickets</b></a> remain cheaper at this time.  </p>
