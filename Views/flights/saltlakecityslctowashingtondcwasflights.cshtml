            <p class="text-justify">March through May and September through November are the ideal periods to visit Washington, D.C.

Spring is second to fall and is considered a brief high season because of the National Cherry Blossom Festival in late March and early April. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The summer months in D.C. are oppressively hot and muggy, providing poor weather for outdoor exploration.
