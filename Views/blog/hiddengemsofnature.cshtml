                <p><b>Hidden gems of hiking trails</b> are those trails hidden far away from the bustling life and offer that untouched tranquillity of nature to an adventurer. Such trails prove refreshing in a very different way than any tourist destination to adventurous people by totally immersing them in natural sceneries. Whether it is an isolated mountain pass, an enigma of a forest, or a peaceful path by a lake, you surely can find hidden treasures around the world for everyone's taste. To help you explore these <b>underrated hiking trails</b>, far away from the well-trodden path, FaresMatch brings you all the travel options.</p>

                <h2>The Magical and Enchanted Lush Greenery of Havasupai Falls (USA, Arizona)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Why Visit:</b> Havasupai Falls is one of the most spectacular hidden waterfalls in the United States, accessible by foot, horseback, or helicopter. This place is deep in the Grand Canyon and has cascading waters that tumble down red rock cliffs surrounded by vibrant greenery. It is paradise among the rugged desert and an oasis among the lush vegetation. Although the hike is tough, you get to see five spectacular falls inside Supai village.</li>
                    <li><b>Why It's a Hidden Gem:</b> The only reason to get a permit is because the lack of distance and permits would mean the Havasupai Falls trail would see far fewer visits compared with other Grand Canyon hikes. The trail leading to it is, of course, a long trek through the blazing heat of the desert, making it almost impossible for crowds.</li>
                    <li><b>Travel Tip:</b> Plan your visit and book the permits a long time in advance (sometimes close to a year), as many trek for many days into the canyon and get extreme exercise just to get there.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>The Enchanted Tongariro Alpine Crossing (North Island, New Zealand)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>What is bringing you here:</b> The <b>best would be all the hiking trails</b> in New Zealand. The Tongariro Alpine Crossing, read as 12 miles of alien volcanic terrain travel over what appear to be craters and emerald-hued lakes, finally emerging into alpine meadows, contains some of the most breathtaking views of this magnificently beautiful land. The hike passes through an active volcanic landscape, including Mount Ngauruhoe (famously known as Mount Doom from The Lord of the Rings).</li>
                    <li><b>Why It Is a Hidden Gem:</b> It might be one of New Zealand's most famous tracks, but with terrain that's so varied and often gives the sense of being quite a way out from everything, this feels like an untouched world. Hiking through an active volcanic zone makes that bit more adventurous.</li>
                    <li><b>Travel Tip:</b> Pack well for all weather because it might change quickly. Also, check on volcanic activity alerts before you set out on the hike.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Beat The Trip Or Hike Off Route-Alta Via 1 (Italy)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Why Go:</b> The Dolomites are often associated with razor-backed mountain ridges, yet the less-travelled Alta Via 1 shows you this side of Italy through beautiful valleys. Those who love the other side of nature will not fail to enjoy this trail: eye-popping sightings of mighty, savage mountain ranges, tranquil alpine lakes, and quaint alpine villages. Indeed, a hike that fetches wellness with a rustic cosiness is the great mountain spirit of traditional Italian mountain culture. </li>
                    <li><b>Hidden Wonders:</b> The great high and low at travel to the famous Dolomites has long since been made above the beautiful hiking trails and postcard-perfect huts of Alta Via 1. It claims to be the most secluded hiking experience of them all on a continent that is already exceptional for its hiking trails. This 11-day trek is largely reserved for those who never quite got the hang of hiking, and therefore anyone can find the place as peaceful as can be when almost empty of casual tourists. </li>
                    <li><b>Advice When Travelling:</b> Because this trek is quite long, make arrangements for overnight stays in mountain huts and prepare for sudden weather changes, including snowstorms, mostly at the highest altitudes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Visit the secret serenity of Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Why Visit:</b> Tsingy de Bemaraha is a UNESCO World Heritage site hidden in the heart of Madagascar. It is famous for its unique setting, hosting dramatic, jagged limestone spires that rise out of the forest floor and are called 'Tsingy.' The path leads through limestone forests and affords some breathtaking views of these interesting geological formations, caves, and diverse wildlife.</li>
                    <li><b>Why It's a Hidden Gem:</b> Tsingy de Bemaraha is not much of a mainstream tourism attraction because it is so off the beaten path (the ruggedness of the area is a rough distance), and there is no real infrastructure, so it's all dedicated adventure hunters coming on those paths, keeping pristine beauty.</li>
                    <li><b>Travel Tip:</b> You can only explore once a local guide is available, and access is limited by the rainy season (December to March). Be ready for some tough, adventurous climbs between the Tsingy formations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Tranquil Wilderness in the Faroe Islands: Denmark.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>What makes it unique:</b> The Faroe Islands were made for hikers looking for their solitude amid this rugged, windy landscape. It comprises islands in the North Atlantic, impressive cliffs, a mighty coastal view, and rich valleys. Trails like that leading up to Lake Sorvagsvatn—the so-called floating lake—have amazing viewpoints that nearly seem about to defy gravity. </li>
                    <li><b>Why It's a Secret:</b> No longer just for die-hard nature lovers, the Faroe Islands are still pretty much behind the rest of Europe in crowds. The distance and fairly unpredictable weather keep many tourists at bay, bringing it all so wonderfully close to that search for the finest deserted, untouched spot. </li>
                    <li><b>Travel Tip:</b> Pack clothing that can withstand the weather changes because it can change in an instant. Make sure to visit the idyllic village of Gasadalur, recently known to the world for its amazing scenery.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Kungsleden Trail, the Secluded Wilderness of Sweden</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Why Go There:</b> Perhaps one of the most calm and beautiful hiking destinations in Europe, Sweden's Kungsleden Trail makes for a brilliant 270-kilometre adventure through the very heart of Lapland in Sweden, with alpine vistas, deep valleys, and serene lakes. This wilderness adventure begins in Abisko National Park and ends in Hemavan.</li>
                    <li><b>Why Hidden Gem Trail:</b> One reason is that it is very secluded, and while serious trekkers frequent it, the chance is that the trail is not nearly as crowded as other European hiking destinations should be. Its only truly untouched landscapes and pristine environment will always make the place one of the best for a trek.</li>
                    <li><b>Travel Tip:</b> The trail can be hiked piece by piece, with several huts dotting the route that provide shelter and food, so it can be done even in quite remote parts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>The Picos de Europa (Spain): the Underrated One</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Why Visit:</b> In addition to being a very fine mountain range, the Picos de Europa is located in northern Spain; it has staggering cliffs, sprawling valleys, and powerful peaks. Inside this little paradise are tracks for walkers, varying from easy, resonating challenges to perhaps serious ones. One of the most excellent is the Cares Gorge Trail, which trails through a dramatic canyon over the vistas of some of the finest views in Spain.</li>
                    <li><b>Why It's a Hidden Gem:</b> The Picos de Europa, in truth, doesn't quite match up to the Pyrenees or Sierra Nevada for top billing among Spain's more famous hiking spots and as such falls under a sombre radar for the masses in search of an authentic mountain experience minus the buzz.</li>
                    <li><b>Travel Tip:</b> Spring or autumn visits provide excellent hiking conditions with milder weather and less crowded than summer months.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Hidden hiking trails</b> are perhaps the most unique and rarest experiences on which one could ever embark, far away from well-trodden paths. Havasupai Falls, the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, and the all-gazing Faroe Islands serve the purists of pristine nature to surrender in tranquillity and relished vistas.
