                <p class="text-justify">Air traveling is pretty fun and the easiest and fastest mode of transport. Air travel provides customers with the most comfortable and luxurious journey. However, to fly elegantly, you need to pay a lot. But applying a few tips and tricks allows you to book flights at the lowest price easily. Tickets booking must be made in advance to get the most affordable prices. Most airlines do not ask for penalties on canceling tickets. </p>

                <h2>How far in advance must one Book Domestic Flights</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Generally, one must book domestic flights for at least one or four months to get cheap flight tickets. Even though the airline schedules are posted a year or so in advance, it is unnecessary to undergo the tickets booking process so far in advance. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>When the schedule opens, the airline typically releases more expensive fares to convince some eager travelers to book flights at higher fares. </li>
                    <li>Airline tickets have strict expiration policies as they typically end within a year when they are issued. This causes a problem for travelers who book far in advance and then need to reschedule or cancel their flights. </li>
                    <li>By booking closer to the date of departure, you will be buying yourself some insurance for your upcoming schedule. Do not wait just a few days before booking your flight, as airline fares are guided by specific fare buckets available at certain preset dates before the flight. Cheaper fares are reserved for purchases which are made at least 21 days before your departure. </li>
                    <li>During peak holiday periods, it is best to lock in your flight at least four months in advance to get hold of cheap tickets. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">Try to compare fares at least six months to nine months in advance and plan to book around the sixth month, and you will get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-fare-airline-tickets.aspx">cheap airline tickets</a>. </p>

                <h2>How far in advance one must Book International Flights</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Try booking international flights at least six months or so in advance, as you might want to give yourself more time to research than domestic itineraries. Monitor the fares on international flights about ten months before your departure, pay attention to the trends carefully, and check if they are going up or down. As it gets closer to the six-month mark, you will get a fair idea of the pricing over time. If you notice a decrease in fare, it is best to wait for some days. Therefore update yourself regularly on the airlines' deals section and sign up for the newsletter. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    One of the most important tips for booking an international flight is that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always try to include a Saturday night stay on round-trip tickets. </li>
                    <li>Airlines know that most business travelers want to go home during the weekend. As a result, you might find fares round-trip is much more expensive. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tips to get cheap air tickets on any airline</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Below are some points you must note before booking your flights: </p>

                <h4>Try to be flexible with the dates as much as possible</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">You can easily buy cheap plane tickets by being flexible with your dates. The flight ticket price largely depends on the time of the year or the day of the week you have planned your trip. During times of the holiday season, the costs will be relatively higher. Mid-week days are generally found to be ideal for getting <a href="">cheap air tickets</a> than the weekends. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Therefore always be flexible with your dates before booking tickets to avoid any upsurge in the cost of the tickets. You might never know that there are possibilities for the airline to reduce the cost of their tickets on the next day of your departure. So, being flexible has proved to help save money at the very last moment and give you cheap tickets. </p>

                <h4>Comparing tickets on multiple search engine</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">You might wonder how to get a plane ticket online. There are various flight searching apps and websites through which you can easily find and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">book cheap flights online</a>. Try to use different flight searching websites during your search for flights. You might notice that some search engines have a higher rate than others. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The rates of flights change from one search engine to another. This happens to depend on their cut from airlines. Sometimes you may find that not all the list of carriers is listed in the search engines. Therefore it is a necessary step to search for flights on at least two or three search engines. After getting the list of your preferred flight, you can compare them and choose the one that suits your needs the best. </p>

                <h4>Searching flights in incognito mode</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">The booking websites and engines store the search history and cookies from the browser. As a result, it repeatedly increases the airfare of a searched route. The website manipulates the customers so that the price rises further. So the customers book the tickets and raise the cost of the flights. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">This problem can be avoided by searching for your flights in your browser's incognito mode. The website will display the same price with every search, thus providing you with the correct information. </p>

                <h4>Benefits of social media deals</h4>

                    <li>You can earn specific points or miles on your future flight with the airline. </li>
