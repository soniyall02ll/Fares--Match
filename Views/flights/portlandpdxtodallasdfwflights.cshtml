            <h2>Perfect time to book your Dallas Flight</h2>

            <p>It is perhaps important to know that the Dallas weather can change quite dramatically. The traveling time in Dallas is preferred to be during Spring and the fall seasons, that is, from March up to May and September to November with average high temperatures being 25 degrees Celsius and the low not dropping below 15 degrees Celsius. Summer is hot embracing June, July, and August with the highest temperature experienced in August while winter is also rough for most parts with slight showers embraced in December, January, and February. The spring seasons of March and May are not as warm as summer but they might rain. It's inadvisable to travel during the summer season if you want to avoid getting submerged with the number of people going to the beach. However, the worst or rather unfavorable month to travel to Dallas is during winter probably the months of January and February.</p>
