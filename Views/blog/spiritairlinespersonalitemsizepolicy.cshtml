This airline allows passengers to bring one personal item for free and is a cost-effective option for the light-packers. This item typically includes -</p>
                <p>Backpacks</p>
                <p>Purses</p>
                <p>Laptop bags</p>
                <p>Small totes</p>
                <p>Briefcases</p>

                <p>18 x 14 x 8 inches (45 x 35 x 20 cm), including handles and wheels.</p>

Hence, choosing the right bag is essential and must and designed to meet Spirit airlines size requirements. Also, pack essentials only and prioritize the must-have items such as travel documents, wallet, electronics, and clothes.

                <h2>What Happens if Your Bag is Too Big in Spirit Airlines?</h2>
                <p>If your bag is too big at Spirit Airlines, you must pay the extra carry-on or checked bag price at Spirit Airlines. The baggage fee is higher when paid at the gate. Thus, if you have extra baggage, pre-pay for the bags to avoid additional charges.</p>
