                <p class="text-justify">
                    Are you the person who likes more offers? We have seen many e-commerce discounts throughout the year, but have you ever heard of 300-dollar discounts for tourism packages? JetBlue Airlines from the United States has announced the deals for a limited period under certain conditions. So here in this article, we will discuss the offers and their inclusive package deals in a detailed manner.
                </p>

                <h2>JetBlue Airlines</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">JetBlue Airlines is the American region's low-cost airline and the seventh largest airline in North America. It was established in 1999 by David Neeleman. The airlines attracted their customers with their <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/low-cost-flights-booking-deals.aspx">low-cost tourism packages</a>. And now they have announced the $300 discount for the vacation packages. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">However, this is not the first time they have announced a limited deal; even they announced it last year (2021). As the name suggests, this deal will be limited to a few days. But this year, 2022, they have started this deal from June to September 2022. </p>

                <h4>Dates to be remembered</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">For last-minute vacation packages and late summer packages, the tickets must be booked within June 16, and for early fall getaways, the deal will be from June 20 through September 30, 2022. And the customers have to use code <b>"SUMMER22"</b> to avail of the benefits. (Please be careful with the caps and numbers!) </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The sale offers a 300-dollar discount for the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/jetblue-vacation-packages.aspx">JetBlue Vacations</a> flight and hotel package or the flight and cruise package. So, it is either that or a cruise package. Flights and hotels, or flights and cruises. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">But the sale underlined the most important condition: the sale will be applicable if the customer chooses at least the packages worth 2000 dollars. Customers will receive the $300 offer if they choose the 2000-dollar flight travel package. </p>

                <h4>Similar offers</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">There is another subpart within JetBlue Airlines, and that is JetBlue Vacations. Customers who book their vacation packages through JetBlue Vacations will receive free in-flight beverages and early boarding times as part of this deal. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">And those who book the hotels from JetBlue Airlines' very" Important Perks Category" will be awarded complimentary spa services, extended check-out timings, gifts, and resort credits. </p>
