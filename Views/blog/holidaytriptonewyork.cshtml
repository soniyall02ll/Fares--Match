                <p class="text-justify">New York is arguably the best place for tourists, and every traveler who loves to travel the world has New York on their list. Called the “Big Apple,” New York is a city that never sleeps. Tourists can find entertainment and people every second of the day. Tourists can go grab the best food served in Chinatown, visit the busiest theatre called Broadway or delve into the city’s history by taking a stroll down Washington Square Park; New York has a myriad of things to keep people engaged throughout the day. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">However, while planning a New York trip itinerary, tourists must keep in mind a few things, including airlines, availability of tickets, and discounts. Choosing the right airlines, frequently checking for the proper tickets, and keeping an eye on the different types of discounts and deals that can help save money are useful when choosing <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/holiday-trip-to-new-york.aspx">New York trip packages</a>.</p>

                <h2>Right Airlines choice is important</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">While some airlines offer low and affordable tickets, others offer pricey tickets but a better in-flight experience. Hence, choosing the best airline for a tourist is important. Some people might want to travel to New York on a budget or have no plans on an exclusive flight. For them, the airlines that provide the cheapest and most affordable tickets are the best since they do not need any in-flight amenities. But, the more expensive airlines are better for people looking to go all-out during their trip or for people who do not want to cut costs since they provide exclusive and exciting in-flight experiences. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Also, choosing an airline with a huge network, well-maintained planes, and flies to domestic and international destinations is advisable. JetBlue and Southwest airlines are two such airlines that offer their passengers Cheap Airlines Reservations and affordable <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">airplane tickets</a>. Tourists can check out the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/jetblue-vacations.aspx">JetBlue vacation packages</a> and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-airlines-vacations.aspx">Southwest airlines vacation packages</a> to find the one that suits them the most. </p>

                <h2>Proper luggage selection</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Luggage is an important aspect of traveling regarding physical labor and finances. More luggages mean that the tourists have to carry more items than usual which may lead to slowing down during their tour. More luggages may also mean extra expenses while traveling on a flight. Most airlines allow up to one personal item to be carried by the passenger for free, which means that the rest of the luggage will require an extra fee to be carried on the flight. However, there are a few ways to avoid these extra expenses: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Properly selecting the luggage often reduces the number of items to be carried, reducing the extra costs. Passengers are advised to carry the bare necessities with them, for the rest of the things can be bought during their trip. This will drastically reduce baggage costs. </li>
                    <li>If the amount of luggage is large, then packing them properly in bags can also help reduce the costs. Properly arranging and packing the things in bags will reduce the number of bags, and since the baggage costs are determined by the number of bags carried this will greatly reduce the cost. </li>
                    <li>Choosing an airline with a proper baggage system can help reduce costs, too, since some airlines offer special discounts and features on their baggage policies. </li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Selecting the right time to book tickets</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">The prices and availability of tickets do not solely depend on the airline chosen. It also depends on the time and place from where the tickets are booked. Tourists are advised to book their tickets or plan their trips during weekdays when the normal traffic on the airline sites is quieter. Also, there are seasonal ticket sales on most airline sites, which helps choose the proper tickets at a low price. There is another lesser-known tactic of finding the best deals on flights, which is, going incognito while searching for the tickets. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Most airline sites retrieve user information to find out whether that user will book a ticket. That means if a user searches for flights while incognito, the airline sites cannot assess whether that user is going to book a ticket, and hence the prices of the tickets do not fluctuate and remain the same as when the user visited the site first. This helps a lot when a user is searching for a flight through numerous websites. </p>

                <h2>Looking for loyalty programs</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Loyalty programs are certain subscription-based features offered by airlines to their regular users. The features offered may include: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Miles programs allow users to convert the number of miles flown with that airline into equivalent discounts on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">flight tickets</a>. The discounts do not end on flights only; they also include hotels, car rentals, and vacations. </li>
                    <li>Points-based programs award the users points against the flights they have flown. The points depend on the flight length, class, number of seats booked, and destination. </li>
                    <li>Some loyalty programs feature their credit card system wherein a user can gain points based on the number and quantity of purchases made using that credit card. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">Loyalty programs are a great way to gain certain discounts and deals which make flying enjoyable and affordable. Since these programs also allow discounts and deals on hotels, car rentals, and vacations, users will find the New York trip easy and enjoyable. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The above were some methods of making your trip easy. Of course, this list is not exhaustible, and numerous other aspects determine the trip's quality.
