            <p><b>Day 1:</b> Visit the wonderful St. Louis Cathedral and take an eye on the street performer's Station such as a jazz musician in Jackson Square in the Morning. If history interests you, then Presbytère or Cabildo is located just nearby and is a must-visit.  Visit Montmartre district in the afternoon and buy souvenirs, art crafts, or any other French-related items in this ancient open-air market. Following is Bourbon Street, the famous street of many bars, live music performances, and boutique shops. For good southern dining go to a restaurant offering live jazz such as the Spotted Cat Music Club or Blue Nile.</p>

            <p><b>Day 2:</b> Explore the Garden District in the morning by strolling through the old Southern mansion, oaks, and the number one cemetery, Lafayette, in the morning. The guided walking tours are recommended here. Experience world-class art and history in the afternoon at one of the best museums, the National WWII Museum full of exhibits and artifacts. Make your way to experience a musical night like no other by booking the dining cruise along the Mississippi River at night with a buffet dinner.</p>

            <p><b>Day 3:</b> Take a thematic boat or swamp tour in the morning which includes a sightseeing of Louisiana's swamps and bayous as well as waiting for the view of the alligators and herons. Ride around the city park in the evening with stops at the New Orleans Museum of Art, the water bodies in the park, and the mysteriously Alluring Besthoff Sculpture Garden. The last meal before departure shouldn't be boring, so visit Peche Seafood Grill where you will find fresh seafood, freshly caught in local waters.</p>



            <h3>Weather in New Orleans</h3>

            <p>New Orleans in spring is remarkable. Summer arrives with average relative humidity; the city wakes up as the heat increases. It would be great if you could coordinate your visit with the French Quarter Festival which is held in mid-April to showcase Louisiana music, food, and the like and where free tours of the beautiful homes and gardens in the French Quarter area are conducted. The weather may also be good in the fall, the temperatures range between the mid-60s and up to the high 70s. Hotel prices are the lowest in August – that's the right time for booking a stay at one of the best hotels in New Orleans, if this is on your wish list; average domestic flights are also the cheapest from July through September.</p>
