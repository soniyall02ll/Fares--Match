            <h3>When to Visit San Francisco</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>San Francisco is one of the cities in the world that has an all-year-round travelling excitement; however, the season of experience is quite subjective based on preference.</li>
                <li>September to November is the best time when it comes to perfect weather and few people. Summer fog is cleared away, and it is mild and pleasant.</li>
                <li>Winter (December through February) gives cooler and cheaper airfare options, but the Christmas lights and festive spirit make it more attractive. Spring (March to May) is a good time for travel as well since this period has fewer tourists and cheaper fares.</li>
                <li>For the budget traveller, the winter months are usually the best time to find <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-flights-ticket.aspx"><b>cheap tickets</b></a>. FaresMatch also deals with many of these low-cost tickets for short, off-season travel, where you can visit San Francisco.</li>
