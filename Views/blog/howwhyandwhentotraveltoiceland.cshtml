                            <p class="text-justify">Iceland is most famous for its beautiful landscapes and scenery. The Northern Lights, volcanoes, Blue Lagoon, glaciers, and waterfalls top the list of most-seeing. It is also famous for its history and for being settled by the Vikings. It is known as “The Land of Fire and Ice” for its contrasting landscapes. Iceland is full of the most exciting activities and breathtaking landscapes. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">You can witness geysers, waterfalls, glaciers, volcanoes, valleys, and endless stretches of black sandy beaches. There are many <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/how-why-and-when-to-travel-to-iceland.aspx">things to do in Iceland</a>, for activities you can go hiking, snowmobiling, biking, kayaking, or just soak up the warmth of a natural hot spring. </p>

                            <h2>What is the best time to travel to Iceland? </h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">While its far north ocean location makes for fluctuating weather, summer is the perfect time to visit Iceland. June-September offers long daylight hours, low 21°Cs warmth, plus summer festivals. Dry weather makes this prime hiking season. May to September is the best time of year if you want to go whale watching. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Snow comes as early as September and can linger to May, but it is very photogenic in autumn and early winter. Winter in Iceland especially in November-March can be brutal and road closures make it difficult to access some areas but offer a better chance at seeing the Northern Lights. You can combine orca watching with the Northern Lights in February and April. </p>

                            <h3>Booking a ticket for Iceland</h3>

                            <h2>Where to stay in Iceland</h2>
                            <h3>Reykjavik Hotels</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Iceland's capital city of Reykjavik has the longest range of hotels in the country, suiting all budgets and needs. Whether traveling on a low budget or looking for a lavish getaway, you’re very sure to find the place for you. </p>

                            <h3>Best Places to Stay in Reykjavik</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">The best place to stay in Reykjavik is near the Laugavegur shopping street. There you can find most of the best attractions, restaurants, and souvenir shops in Reykjavik. Those with a high budget have an array of luxury hotels to choose from. Hotel Borg is a beautiful building located right in the downtown area, with 98 deluxe rooms in the Art Deco style. The Icelandair Hotel Marina overlooks a stunning harbor and is good for those with a more refined taste. </p>

                            <h3>Cottages and Camping in Reykjavik</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">The options listed above are not the only ones. The city hosts a large campsite with many amenities. There are also cottages available for rent in and just outside of the city. </p>

                            <h3>Where to Stay Near Keflavik Airport</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">It may be more convenient for some tourists to stay closer to Keflavik airport. Hotel Keflavik is a four-star institution with a modern vibe and many on-site amenities. Meanwhile, Start Hostel and Alex Guesthouse are much simpler and more affordable, with their own unique charms. </p>


                            <h2>What are the things we can do in Iceland and what is the Iceland travel guide? </h2>

                            <h3>Going on a whale-watching tour </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Whale watching is one of the best things you can do in Iceland. Over twenty-one species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises call the Icelandic coastal waters home, ranging from the small harbor porpoises to the earth’s largest animals, blue whales. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">The most common species to see are humpback whales and minke whales, although there’s always the possibility of viewing rarer animals, such as fin whales and killer whales. Like many Iceland tours, whale-watching guests also spot various exotic seabirds, including skuas, guillemots, Arctic terns, and even the colorfully billed puffin. </p>

                            <h3>Blue Lagoon Spa </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">The Blue Lagoon holds the honor of being the most famous spa because of its warm, healing silica mud, soothing water, charming surroundings, and billowing steam stacks. It’s agreed to be one of Iceland’s top things to do. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Even visitors, who only have a limited time in Iceland, such as a long layover, can take a quick Blue Lagoon tour. If the Blue Lagoon is out of your budget, other spas will have similar experiences, such as the Secret Lagoon near the Golden Circle and the Myvatn Nature Baths in North Iceland. </p>

                            <h3>Witnessing Northern lights </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">One of biggest Iceland’s draws is the northern lights, otherwise, it is known as the aurora borealis. This natural light display occurs only in the winter and only in the earth’s northernmost areas. This incredible phenomenon, dancing in ribbon-like waves of purple, green, and gold, is a must experience at least once in a lifetime. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">To see them, conditions must be perfect: flaring activity, limited-or-no cloud cover in the magnetosphere, and no light pollution. When they do appear, there is no knowing exactly when, where, or how long the lights will dance. But that is part of what makes them a must-see in Iceland. </p>

                            <h3>Glacier hiking and ice caving </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">As its name suggests, Iceland is a land defined by frozen landscapes. It is a country of sweeping glaciers, floating icebergs, and dazzling blue ice caves. Most visitors are surprised to find the country temperate and mild, at least during the warm days of the summer. It is during the winter, however, that Iceland truly lives up to its name. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">It is an environment perfectly trapped between darkness and glittering white snow. The real icy experience is entering one of the country’s gorgeous blue ice caves. These are however only accessible in the winter months. </p>

                            <h3>Golden Circle tour and snowmobiling </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">You can drive the Golden Circle within a few hours. Visitors choose to begin the drive in the morning and then participate in activities during the rest of the day. Other options are to spread out the drive over a few days and make time for snorkeling tours and snowmobile tours for extra excitement. Thingvellir National Park is important to visitors for many reasons, one of which is its natural beauty. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">It is also where medieval Icelanders formed the world’s first democratically elected parliament in 930 AD. In Thingvellir National Park, you will see the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates emerging from the earth. It’s a great natural site. It is also home to Silfra Fissure, one of the top ten snorkeling spots in the world. </p>

                            <h3>Horse Riding Tour </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">The Icelandic horse is probably the country’s most famous four-legged resident. It is instantly recognizable for its diminutive stature, short legs, and muscular build. This isolated breed is famed for its reliability, resistance to harsh natural elements, and five gaits. It is such a unique breed that breeding them with other horses is prohibited to maintain the unique genetics. A horse that leaves the country can never return. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">By choosing to partake in an Icelandic horse riding tour many visitors guarantee themselves a tried-and-tested method of experiencing Icelandic nature. Touring on a horseback has been a popular way of seeing Iceland for centuries, during which time the original Norwegian breed evolved into the animal we know today. It is also one of the fun things to do in Iceland for people of all ages. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">These are some travel guides for Iceland. Iceland regularly ranks among the safest countries in the world both for locals and travelers. Global Finance Magazine ranked Iceland the world's safest country for 2019 for its low crime rate and low risk to life. When it comes to traveling, Iceland was recently named one of the safest countries to visit in 2021. The island is also one of the world's most tolerant countries. So, it is completely safe to travel to Iceland with your loved ones for your vacation.</p>
