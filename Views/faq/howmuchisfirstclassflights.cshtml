            <p>Every person who is going to pay extra, and we think so much extra for business class travel, always wants to know about the pricing factors and pillars. So many significant pillars divide the cost of first class and economy class. You need to understand how much first-class flights cost and what services are included in this cost. Welcome to another QNA page of the Faresmatch, where you can determine the significant things of business class travel. People love to fly in business class because of the excellent services and world-class travel amenities. </p>
            <h2>More Comfort and More Luxury = First Class Flight</h2>
            <p>The cost of the first-class flight is very high in comparison to the economy or premium economy class, but this cabin class also offers more comfort and more luxury to the passengers with exclusive amenities. The cost varies on different factors, including route, airline, and travel destination. However, we are going to break down all the factors here. </p>
            <h3>Domestic flights start from $100</h3>
            <p>Yes, at the average cost of $100, you can travel for the domestic routes in the United States for the first-class cabin. We can't give you the exact cost here, but you can talk with our travel agents by telling them your route and know the precise airline price structure for first-class travel services on domestic routes. </p>
            <h3>International flights start from $150</h3>
            <p>With an average difference of $50, you can travel for international flights from the US, and the price starts at $150. Again, the exact international business class flight cost is based on the flag carrier's distance, airline, and premium services. </p>
            <h2>What factors decide the cost of the first-class cabin? </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The first factor is always the airline. The airline cabin classes cost different, and every airline offers different services and charges different prices for the amenities in the business class. Delta One is the first-class cabin of<b> <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx">Delta Airlines flights</a>, </b>and this premium cabin class offers luxury services.</li>
                <li>The second most important factor in the first-class flight price is the route. High-demand routes usually have higher ticket prices.</li>
                <li>Season also matters a lot, and if you travel to any destination during the high season, the price of a first-class ticket will be higher.</li>
                <li>Your booking timing greatly matters in finding the best deals on first-class flights and booking early helps you find great deals.</li>
            </ol>
