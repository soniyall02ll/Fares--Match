            <h2>When to book flights to Houston? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">If you are wondering which is the perfect time to visit Houston, here's a guide to help you find the best times to book flights. Houston is most enjoyable in February through April or September through November. Houston enjoys warm weather and reasonably priced hotel accommodations almost all year round because of its closeness to the Gulf of Mexico. However, spring and fall bring pleasant temperatures and various festivals. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Since Houstonians relocate when the temperature rises, you can find a better deal in the summer, but you'll have to deal with the intense heat and muggy humidity. Although it rarely snows in Houston, the city does have mild winters. If you plan to travel in December or January, remember to pack layers because the temperature drops as the day goes on. </p>
