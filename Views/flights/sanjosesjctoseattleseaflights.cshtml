            <p class="text-justify">Nestled between mountains, evergreen woods, and the Pacific Northwest's Puget Sound, Seattle has thousands of acres of parkland. The biggest city in Washington State is home to a sizable tech sector, with the headquarters of Microsoft and Amazon located in the surrounding metro region. The most famous feature is the futuristic Space Needle, a relic from the 1962 World's Fair. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Starbucks and the coffee culture in general, the grunge music scene, the Seahawks, the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, the headquarters of many tech companies (including Microsoft and Amazon), hiking, kayaking, and an all-around outdoor lifestyle (think REI) are all reasons why Seattle is well-known. The lack of reasonably priced homes in Seattle frequently makes news. However, these numbers demonstrate how much more expensive food, healthcare, and other services are for locals, making living in the Emerald City even more prohibitive.
