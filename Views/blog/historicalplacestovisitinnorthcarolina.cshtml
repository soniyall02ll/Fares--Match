                <p class="text-justify">The state's rich history began with the arrival of the first wave of English settlers in 1585. Since then, it was enlisted among the historical places of the world, which experienced tragic incidents like the French and Indian war, the revolutionary war, the civil war and a lot more.

                <h2>Top 5 historical Places </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">In such a history-related place, where tragedy and art are like the two leaves in a single branch, it is really hard to pick the top 5 historic places. The timeline of North California rolls way back, when we talk about the history and popular events. Despite that, here are the top 5 most popular historical places of northern California: </p>

                <h3>Bennett Place </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Walking down memory lane, we first need to know a bit of history about this place. Little do people know about this story that, even after Robert E. Lee surrendered on 9th April 1865, the confederate troops continued marching towards the Carolinas until they called a truce. Central north California at that time was not that developed, so they agreed to meet at a farmhouse which belonged to James and Nancy Bennett. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">The place experienced a history of surrender, which demobilized around 90000 troops. The house is now recognized as a state historic site within the premises of Durham city limits. This is a must-visit and tops the list when you visit the town. </p>
                <h3>Kitty Hawk </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">This place's history is fun and remembered as a positive memory. In 1903, Kitty Hawk launched a rocket from the top of a famous place in the town because of a short visit from the wright brothers in their newly launched plane. They took the plane and travelled to kill devil hill in the south of the outer banks of north California. After this moment, history was made along with the biggest invention of humanity. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">The first plane flew that day, and that moment changed the lifestyle of all today. The windy dunes are among the historical tourist attraction from where they left the solid ground for the first time. </p>
                <h3>Roanoke island festival park </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The history behind this place is short, but it greatly impacted history. The first English travellers marched in two waves in 1585 and 1587 and made their first mark in Roanoke Island Festival Park. The place is believed to have mystically vanished after that incident, and the reason is still not found. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">The place is now a park for many exhibitions on how life might have been if the place had existed. The place is also famous for a monument of a ship that a fellow tourist can climb. They organize various exhibitions on American-Indian history, culture and the story of the place before the Englishmen arrived. </p>
                <h3>Battleship USS North Carolina </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The history of World War 2 can be cherished from a visit to the battleship USS of North Carolina. The so-called peak of naval weaponry was commissioned in 1941. It was an integral part of the Second World War as it survived many attacks from the Japanese, losing only 10 men throughout the war. It took part in the pacific theatre and was decommissioned in 1947.  </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Instead of treating it as scrap after use, many residents got it petitioned and brought her back home. It now serves as a brave and independent monument memorial of the war veterans and service members lost during the Second World War.  </p>
                <h3>The University at chapel hill </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Authorized in the late 1789s, it is one of the oldest UNC universities in the United States. It officially opened its doors for all undergraduates in 1795 and is also the only university conferring degrees in the early 18th century. It is one of the oldest and flagship colleges in the world as the campus reflects its rich history and tradition over the centuries. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The architecture is still the same and symbolic of the antiques along with the old well, which is the oldest and the biggest symbol of the university. The university spread its wings and now competes with many other competitors with a close one beside them.
                </p>
