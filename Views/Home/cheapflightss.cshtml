                <h3>Cheap Flight Tickets- Tips for Booking</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Below are some tips from FaresMatch that will surely get you the lowest flight tickets. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Being flexible with dates:</strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you are flexible with your date, grabbing cheap flight fare is not such a great deal. The price of the flight tickets dramatically depends on the date and time of your journey. You must only book your tickets during holidays and weekends. Booking during weekdays is the best way to get top deals on cheap flight tickets. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Booking in advance: </strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify">Best flight prices can be secured only if you know your journey's date three weeks before your departure date. Booking tickets as soon as possible is one of the main ways to get a cheap flight ticket to your destination. Flight Finder apps are also great, which will show you various fares. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Booking non-refundable tickets: </strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you have planned your vacation date and are sure about your departure date, try your best to book non-refundable tickets. The reason is that airlines keep the pricing of non-refundable tickets lower than the refundable ones. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Using different currencies: </strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify">Using different currencies while booking is also an efficient way to get cheap flight tickets. Before doing so, you must make sure that your credit card doesn’t charge you fees for foreign transactions. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Joining Frequent Flyer Program: </strong></p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you are a frequent flyer, one of the best options is to travel with the same airlines. Most airlines offer a 'frequent Flyer Program,' which allows you to earn points while booking flights and get cheaper air tickets besides the regular upgrades. </p>
