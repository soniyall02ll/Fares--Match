            <h2>How do I find flights? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>Booking flight tickets</b></a> can be done quickly using flight comparison websites like Faresmatch. Enter your departure and arrival cities, along with your travel dates, into the system to check for available flights offered by multiple airlines. One of the ways you can save money is by deliberately looking for flexible dates, i.e.. Changing your travel dates by a day or two may expose you to lower-priced tickets. When making comparisons of different airlines, consider the prices, flight duration, and layover periods, and factor in the baggage or seat fees when making your reservation. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Creating price alerts through these sites can help if fares go down for your selected route. Having found a better price on a price comparison site, check the airline website to see if there is direct access to the fare, which may offer extra bonuses and better prices. By offering bundled packages, online travel agencies like Expedia, Orbitz, and Faresmatch can save a traveler money on flight tickets, hotel reservations, or car rentals. Verify the reputation of an airline and travel agency by reading reviews before booking. </p>

            <h2>When to book flights? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">For the most advantageous fares on Stockton, CA, to Las Vegas flights, you should make the reservations one to three months before departure. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the most affordable days for booking and flying, and median-week flights are generally cheaper than weekend flights. Use fare comparison tools like Faresmatch and set price alerts to track changes. Booking during the off-season and holidays will provide the opportunity to get lower prices for the trip. For peak travel times or most common events in Las Vegas, booking your stay earlier is better to avoid unavailability and get better rates. </p>
