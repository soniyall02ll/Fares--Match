            <h2>Singapore Airlines Refund Policy</h2>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/singapore-airlines.aspx">Singapore airline </a>is one of the best airlines in terms of its services. If you bought a ticket directly through Singapore Airlines at a changeable rate, you can withdraw your ticket online for reimbursement. </p>
            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Only its refundable taxes would be repaid if you canceled a non-refundable ticket. The reimbursement will be applied to the same credit or debit card that was used to purchase the ticket. There may be a cancellation/refund charge in some cases. To be eligible for a refund, you should return your ticket before the time specified on your reservation. </p>
            <p>Unless you've <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">booked a flight</a> from and to the United States, you can withdraw that without penalty within 24 hours of making the booking as long as everything is one week more than before your journey departs. Your cancellation should be lodged with your regional Singapore Airlines office to guarantee a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/singapore-airlines-refund-policy.aspx">complete refund</a>.</p>
