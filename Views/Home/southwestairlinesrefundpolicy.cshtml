            <h2>Refund Policy at Southwest Airlines</h2>

            <p>Unused and fully refundable flights are eligible for a reimbursement that could be applied to future traveling plans or redeemed within one year of your date of purchase. If a passenger does not choose to transport, he or she may cancel his or her tickets up to 10 mins before the planned departure time. Otherwise, it would be considered a "no show," with the whole refund amounts fortified. </p>

            <p>The refundable aircraft tickets can be requested by calling and writing to the airline directly. A tourist is eligible for reimbursement if the departure flight has already left. </p>

            <p>It's simple to refund one Southwest flight. One can withdraw your reservation by going to southwest.com/cancel and using the Southwest smartphone website. Insert the first as well as last names of the booked passenger, as well as the booking confirmation number.You could also contact Southwest bookings at their website, or look up the ticket on one of My Account settings if you provided your Fast Rewards information on the original reservation. You'll notice any traveling balances and refundable sums associated with the receipt number when you've input your flight details. </p>

            <h3>When will I be able to obtain a refund? Whenever should I anticipate it? </h3>
            <p>In general, the IRS expects most taxpayers to get their refunds around 21 days following filing electronically assuming they select direct transfer and whose tax form is error-free. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) encourages taxpayers including tax experts to file online. </p>
