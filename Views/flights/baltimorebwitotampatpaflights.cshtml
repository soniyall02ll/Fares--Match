            <h3>Perfect Time to Visit Tampa with Travel from Baltimore</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The perfect time to visit Tampa is during the winter and early spring months (December to April) when the weather is favourable for outdoor activities. Tampa also has a subtropical climate, characterized by mild temperatures over the winter to early spring, making it perfect for lounging on its beaches, theme parks, or any other outdoor attractions. </li>
                <li>Many avoided the peak tourist season and airfare hikes by flying during fall (September-November) to ticket-mad Tampa. Although it may hover a little hotter, both <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>airfare tickets</b></a> and hotel prices can be a little friendlier. Also, compared to most times of the year, it is not as full as the rest of the year.</li>
                <li>Travellers trying to keep their trip to Tampa affordable should think about flying during the summer months (June-August). The city can prove hot and very humid during this period; however, flights and hotels are usually at their lowest price point during the summer season. It is easy to track price changes and grab a great deal for your trip even in less-travelled months with FaresMatch.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Booking your flight as early as possible is one of the best ways to have low-cost airfare. Booking flights at least 3 to 4 weeks early usually results in price reductions since airlines increase ticket prices when the date of departure is approaching. </li>
