                <p class="text-justify">Traveling is a beautiful way of exploring places that you have ever thought of. It gives you a clear idea of what all types of culture and tradition are followed at different places on this globe. Are you planning for a trip to the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-booking.aspx">United States</a>? In today's post, we'll cover all you need to know about visiting the United States. </p>

                <h2>Travel advice before traveling abroad</h2>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Apply in advance for the ESTA </h3>

                <p class="text-justify">To go to the United States with a European, UK, or Australian passport, you must first get an ESTA electronic visa. ESTA is an online application that allows you to enter the United States for 90 days. You will not be able to enter the United States unless you complete this procedure. </p>


                <h3 class="text-justify">Carry extra money for all the expenses and backup</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">You know the longer you stay in the United States, the more money you will require. If you're staying for a week and have everything planned out, you'll need at least 700 USD to eat, pay for tickets, and participate in some activities. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">They might ask for proof of $2000 if you're intending to travel for a month. For backup also you should have some extra money so keep in mind that money is going to be a bigger factor and is one of the most important foreign travel advices to follow. </p>


                <h3 class="text-justify">Ask for guided Tours</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Although it is a little expensive, to save time and tour the surrounding places, you should take a guided tour. These guided tours are familiar with English and many may also be aware of your local language. Hence, it won't be a problem building. </p>


                <h3 class="text-justify">Wear Mask</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Another important piece of foreign travel advice to consider is that everyone will need to wear a mask when flying in the United States until at least late March. The federal mask mandate is set to expire on that day. </p>


                <h3 class="text-justify">Pre- Book your flights and hotel accommodation</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">It is always better to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-booking-online-international.aspx">book tickets</a> for flights and chooses accommodation from the day you planned the departure date. This will ease out the headache you may face with getting <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-airlines-low-fare.aspx">tickets at a low cost </a>and hotel booking without waiting for your turn. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><b>Covid-19 travel advice for all the tourists</b>:</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Since the introduction of COVID-19, it has become essential to travel to the United States with travel insurance. Covid-19 travel advice further includes following all the adhered protocols, wearing a mask, using sanitizer, etc. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Many countries are still affected by the covid-19. Hence, they are considered part of US travel restrictions. Tourists from other countries who want to visit the US have to be double vaccinated. Without Vaccination, you won't be allowed to enter the US. </p>

                <h3>Flights to the United States at a Low Cost</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">The greatest approach to getting <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">cheap airline tickets</a> is to be able to go on unusual dates, such as that outside of peak season. There are many last-minute deals also available that you could check on Fares Match. Fares Match is an online travel agency that provides you with a complete traveling solution. It is reliable and you can find cheap deals on this platform for your travel to the US. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><b>Living in the US</b>:</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The US has 50 states and it is completely upon you which location you are choosing to visit for your trip to the US. Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Pismo Beach, Destin, Ocean City, and Gulf Shores are some of the locations you could select to live in the US. More than Hollywood starlets, bronzed skin, and bikini-clad bodies, Los Angeles is a magnet for all things creative and inspiring. From the movies to the clothes to the music and food, L.A. exudes energy and promise that is unrivaled. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Miami is most commonly associated with modern glamour in a warm climate. The white, rounded edges of these Art Deco beauties are proudly shown against a gorgeous bright blue bay, bordered by a sweeping sweep of white - this time sand. San Francisco is famed for its cable cars, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, gay rights, foggy vintage beauty, attractive liberal attitudes, excellent food, cutting-edge technology, and diversity of microclimates, among other things. These are just a few locations. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Motel and hotel costs start at $45 per night in rural areas and rise to $80 in major cities, with savings possible during the off-season. Unsurprisingly, luxury hotels have no boundaries, with excellent suites easily reaching four figures. For an additional $15–25, many hotels will install a third single bed, bringing the total cost of three people sharing a room down. A "single room" for lone travelers, on the other hand, is often a double room at most, with a slight discount. A hostel dorm bed typically costs $20–35 per night, while standards of cleanliness and security can be low, and the cost savings over a motel is often little for groups of two or more. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><b>Travelling within the US</b>:</p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    A rental automobile is the most convenient method to travel across the United States (RV, van, or campers). This is because American roadways are quite straightforward to navigate.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Most rental cars are equipped with a GPS system that includes up-to-date maps. However, if you hire one without GPS, we recommend having access to the internet on your phone so you can utilize Google Maps. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><b>You have two options if you don't want to drive</b>:</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Travelling to the US by bus or train across the United States is a great way to see the country. They have a bus and train system that connects you to the country's most essential locations. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Visit a large city, such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, or San Francisco, and participate in Civitatis or Get Your Guide excursions or guided tours. Excursions with or without a guide are available. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Above we have tried to cover all the information regarding where you should stay, advice before traveling abroad, what all you will need while flying to the US, international travel restrictions, and other travel advice. Further, we would like you to know that if you are planning to visit as a tourist to the US this 2022, choose a reliable platform like Fares Match that can assist you with all your traveling needs so you don't have to check thousands of airline websites and get confused. </p>
