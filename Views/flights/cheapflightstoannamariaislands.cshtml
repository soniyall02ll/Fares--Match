            <h2>Finding flights to Anna Maria islands</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Anna Maria Island takes the lead among the top-notch tourist destinations; as such, it does not have an airport. Travellers to the destination can simply reach the island by flying to nearby airports, like getting <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-florida.aspx"><b>cheap flights to Florida</b></a>, and then proceeding with their visit by ground transportation. The closest major airport to Anna Maria Island is Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (SRQ), which is around 16 miles southeast of the island. The airport just provides a very accessible option for all travellers because of the different airlines that provide flights to/from different destinations throughout the 50 US states. The airport provides car rental services, taxis, or ride-sharing programs to book transport to reach Anna Maria Island. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Another possible airport opportunity is to fly in from the Tampa International Airport (TPA), which is Tampa's largest airport and is located about 50 miles north of Anna Maria Island. Due to its size, Tampa International Airport has more flights and more airlines that connect both domestic and international destinations. In addition to these, tourists may also take flights to St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport (PIE) or Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW), which are in Fort Myers and located further away from Anna Maria Island compared to SRQ and TPA, respectively. </p>

            <h2>When to book flights? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">To get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-flights.aspx"><b>cheap flight tickets</b></a> to Anna Maria Island, try to book the flight at an early stage. In most cases, booking your hotel two to three months before the anticipated departure date is a tactic that can allow you to get the correct prices and availability. Nevertheless, the price is subject to changes depending on the travel dates, the level of demand, and airline special offers. Regular tracking of prices, consideration of flexible travel dates, and taking advantage of airline sales and promotions are keys to minimizing expenses on your journey. Additionally, booking during off-peak times or off-peak seasons can be the primary way to have the most affordable fares. </p>
            <h2>Non-stop flights</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Since a domestic airport does not serve Anna Maria Island, there are no non-stop direct flights to it. Most visitors conveniently fly into either the Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) or the Tampa International Airport (TPA) and then use ground transportation to reach the key. </p>
