            <p>Bangladesh is one of the most important countries in the southern part of Asia and one of the most populous and densely populated countries in the world. It shares borders with India to its north, west, and eastern directions and Myanmar to its southeastern direction. The country is located on the shores of the Bay of Bengal. </p>
            <p>Bangladesh’s tourism sector contributes significantly, with international flights accounting for a sizeable part of the revenue earned from this industry. The country has three United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization World Heritage Sites, lush forests, sparkling rivers, a beautiful coastline, and major cities that form an integral part of the global economy. </p>
            <h2>Bangladesh – My Golden Bangla </h2>
            <p>Bangladesh has earned global recognition for being the second largest economy in the southern part of Asia as well as possessing the third largest military in the region with the greatest contribution to the United Nations Security Forces. Many travellers like to get Singapore flights to Bangladesh to see its remarkable mangrove forest which is the largest in the world. </p>
            <p>Travellers to Bangladesh should note that the official currency of the country is Bangladeshi taka and the official and national language spoken here is Bangla. The Bangla language is a source of great pride for the people as is exemplified by its being one of the primary reasons for the waging of their successful Independence War against Pakistan. </p>
            <p>The climate of Bangladesh is typical of tropical regions with a hot and humid summer season which brings most of the rainfall of the country and a mild winter which provides some relief from the heat and humidity. Natural calamities such as floods, cyclones and tidal bores are a frequent problem that has remained a headache for the country for many decades. </p>
            <h2>Where To Go In Bangladesh? </h2>
