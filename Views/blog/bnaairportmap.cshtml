            <p>One of the most essential tools for any traveler is flying through Nashville International Airport (BNA), and the airport map is your key to a smooth journey. As this airport transforms under its ambitious "New Horizon" expansion plan, understanding the layout from the BNA map is essential. This guide helps you to understand the up-to-date map and enables you to navigate BNA's Terminal, concourse, and ground transportation with confidence. </p>
            <h2>BNA's Layout: One Terminal, Four Concourses</h2>
            <p>This airport is designed for straightforward navigation, featuring a single large terminal building that houses all check-in counters, baggage claims, and one central security point. After clearing security, you will enter the central hub with direct access to the four primary concourses. </p>
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-long"></i> What is Level 1?</h3>
            <p>This Level 1 is for the arrival and the ground transportation, and this is where you find all baggage claim carousels. From here, you can also access the Ground Transportation Center for the primary services, including taxis, rental cars, and ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber. </p>
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-long"></i> What is Level 2?</h3>
            <p>It is for the check-in and ticketing. Here you can manage your reservations or solve queries related to ticket booking because all major airlines' reservations desks are available here.</p>
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-long"></i> What is Level 3?</h3>
            <p>On the other hand, for the security and departures, you need to use Level 3, and here you will find the main security checkpoint which leads to all departure gates. </p>
            <h2>Finding Your Airline and Concourse</h2>
            <p>After passing the security, you can use the signs which are directing you to for specific concourse. The airline locations are generally grouped as follows but always cross-check the boarding pass for the most accurate gate information. </p>
            <p>Once past security, look for the signs directing you to your specific concourse. Airline locations are generally grouped as follows, but always check your boarding pass for the most accurate gate information. </p>
            <p>Concourse A: Hosts airlines such as United Airlines and Alaska Airlines. </p>
            <p>Concourse B: Primarily serves Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines. </p>
            <p>Concourse C: Dominated by <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-airlines.aspx"><b>Southwest Airlines</b></a>, this concourse also provides access to the new Satellite Concourse. American Airlines also has gates here. </p>
            <p>Concourse D also primarily serves Southwest Airlines. </p>
            <h2>The New Satellite Concourse</h2>
            <p>As per the BNA Map expansion, the BNA has added a new freestanding satellite concourse to accommodate more flights. Allegiant, Spirit, JetBlue, and Sun Country mainly use this concourse. </p>
            <h2>How to Access? </h2>
            <p>First ,you need to enter Concourse C and proceed to the shuttle station near gate C13 and use the Electric Shuttle which run continuously, transporting passengers to and from the Satellite Concourse. Always keep the 15 minutes extra to travel from the main terminal to a gate in the Satellite Concourse. </p>
            <h2>BNA Parking Map</h2>
            <p>You can choose the parking as per your budget and requirements, or how long you plan to stay. All parking facilities are well-signed as you approach the airport. There are two terminal garages, including 1 and 2, and these are the closest options and offer covered parking with a short walk to the terminal. They are ideal for short-term parking or those prioritizing convenience. </p>
            <h3>What are the most budget-friendly parking lots? </h3>
            <p>There are two most budget-friendly parking Lots, including Economy Lots, which are B and C. If you are thinking of choosing long-term parking, then select the Economy Lots. Free shuttle buses run every 10 minutes to transport you between the lots and the terminal. The shuttle pick-up and drop-off area is located on Level 1. </p>
            <h3>Valet Parking at BNA Airport</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can choose the Valet parking for maximum convenience. Valet service is available on the ground level of Terminal Garage 1. </p>
            <h2>FAQs about Navigating BNA</h2>
            <h3>1. How do I get between concourses at BNA? </h3>
            <p>Well, all the main concourse Walkways connect a, B, C and D within the secure area. You can walk between them without having to go through security again. However, the Satellite Concourse is different which requires a shuttle ride from Concourse C. </p>
            <h3>2. Is BNA easy to navigate during construction? </h3>
            <p>We know about this fact that "New Horizon construction has changed the airport design, look, and feel, but still BNA remains a single-terminal airport, which simplifies navigation. You can follow the overhead signs and don't hesitate to ask an airport employee for directions. Make sure that you arrive early to account for any potential delays or detours. </p>
            <h3>3. Where is the security checkpoint as per the BNA map? </h3>
            <p>It is a significant security checkpoint on Level 3 of the main terminal, and all passengers will use the checkpoint. </p>
            <h3>4. Is there a train at Nashville airport? </h3>
            <p>Right now, there is no train facility at BNA connecting the concourse. You can use the shuttle service inside the secure area, and here, you can also find the electric bus that runs between Concourse C and the new satellite Concourse. </p>
