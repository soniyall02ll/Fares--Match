                            <p class="text-justify">We all want to book a stopover on a flight. Passengers who love to travel should opt for this. We often don't know how to book a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/free-stopovers-on-your-next-trip.aspx">free stopover on your next flight</a>. When you schedule a stopover in your travels, you can make them for as long as you want. It's a fun way to turn a boring commute into hopscotch of bucket-list items — and if you know the strategy, you can do it by paying less for airfare than you had gone straight to your final destination. </p>


                            <h3>How to book a stopover flight? </h3>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 1. Search hubs from your home airport</b></p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Enter your home airport to see affordable routes from your origin. Fill up the destination, search with flexible dates, and then slide that price filter (left side of the page) as low as it will go to search flights costing $50 and under. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 2. Search hubs from your destination airport</b></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Repeating step 1, we have to search for hubs from your destination point. Most of Europe is super high cheap once you get to the continent. Some fun options you would enjoy as a stopover like Edinburgh, Vienna, Porto, and Rome. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 3. Search routes between your stopover-worthy cities</b></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">We now enter our choice stopover destinations from step 1 into Flights, but again keep the destination blank. We will then swing the map to Europe to see any potential cheap transatlantic routes. This instantly gives hundreds of permutations between all airports in Europe. Now, we have to cross-reference the cheapest European airports with the airports that fly to our destination and then choose the one I want to visit the most. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 4. In the Google Flights multi-city tool, enter your route</b></p>
                            We know it's possible to score a deal on all these routes. We will pull up Google Flights again and input these airports into the multi-city tool. Dates don't matter yet. <p></p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 5. Checking the dates for each leg separately</b></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The next step is to check all three legs separately to find a cheap date for each, and this may be the most time-intensive portion of your research, though we don't see it as a burden. You are opening a separate tab for each leg and pulling up Google Flights to do your pricing. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 6. In your multi-city itinerary, Plug the cheap dates</b></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Once you find your dates, head back to your tab with the multi-city search and begin plugging in your dates. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 7. Book your ticket</b></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">After you've figured out how long you would like to stay at each destination, you can view your final ticket price and book! </p>

                            <p class="text-justify"><b>Step 8. You can use the same process to get home</b></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">You could also use this same strategy for your return flight though it would be understandable if you tried to find the most direct route home after all that traveling. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">If you are thinking of a stopover, it is workable. The more money you save on the flight, the more you will have to spend at your destination. Sometimes, taking the layover option can mean saving much, and that money would be better spent enjoying the food and culture you are going. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Having one day in the middle of your journey (both there and back) is an excellent opportunity to catch up on everything. A stopover allows us to seclude ourselves in the comfort of a hotel room with a proper workspace. On the way there, you can prepare before the onslaught of meetings. </p>
