            <p>Chittagong, known to many travellers as Chattogram, is the second largest city in the country of Bangladesh which has seen significant growth owing to its location on the shores of the Bay of Bengal. Many travellers get international flights to this city to view famous tourist destinations such as Chittagong War Cemetery, Patenga, Foy’s Lake, Jamboree Park and Shah Amanat Bridge. </p>
            <p>The economic prosperity of the city has in large part been facilitated by the development of the Port of Chittagong which is the busiest port among those located in the country and on the body of water. The city has additional importance as the administrative seat of the Chittagong district and the Chittagong division as well as being the business capital of the country. </p>
            <h2>Chittagong – Land Of Twelve Sufi Saints </h2>
            <p>Chittagong is located on the banks of the Karnaphuli river which has allowed development of one of the oldest ports in the world with a functional natural harbour. The city is nestled between the coastal foothills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and along the southeastern coast of the Bay of Bengal in the south eastern part of the country. </p>
            <p>The economy of the city is greatly dependent on its port but also sees contributions from the numerous international banks, headquarters of powerful national conglomerates and diverse industrial centres located here. The city thus welcomes many Singapore flights due to the large number of people travelling here for business and travel related reasons. </p>
            <p>The climate of the city is typical of the tropical monsoon type which leaves it extremely vulnerable to tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean. The name of the city has been derived from the Bangla words chaitya which refers to the Buddhist monasteries which had been situated in large numbers in this region and gram which means village. </p>
            <h2>Attractions of Chittagong</h2>
            <p>Some popular tourist destinations that every traveller should make a point of visiting when getting <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-deals.aspx"><b>flight deals</b></a> to Chittagong are included in the detailed list below for the benefit of first-time visitors. </p>

                <li>Foy’s Lake – Foy’s Lake is an important man made lake which was created with the intent of providing water to the residents of the nearby railway colony. The lake was named after Mr. Foy, who was an engineer associated with the creation of the body of water, and now serves as a popular tourist destination with a amusement park and boating facilities available near it.  </li>
                <li>Shah Amanat Bridge – The Shah Amanat Bridge is located along the N1 national highway across the Karnaphuli River connecting the southern parts of the city, Cox’s Bazaar and Bandarban. The bridge was the second such structure to cross the river and is the first major extradosed bridge of the country, named after the famous Sufi saint Shah Amanat of the eighteenth century. </li>
