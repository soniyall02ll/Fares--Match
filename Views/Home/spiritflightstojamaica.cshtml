        <h3>Things to know about before visiting Jamaica</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Jamaica has a tropical environment with mild temperatures throughout the year. Visitors should carry
                lightweight, breathable clothing and waterproof gear when travelling during the rainy season. With the
                increased danger of illnesses spread by mosquitoes in Jamaica, it's also advised to use sunscreen and
                insect repellent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Safety measures are advised because of Jamaica's high crime rate, especially in urban areas. Tourists
                should exercise caution, avoid strolling alone at night, and avoid flashing essential items like
                electronics or jewellery. They should also use ATMs with caution. Pay attention to your surroundings and
                keep an eye on any valuables you may have.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taxis, buses, and rental automobiles are just a few alternatives in Jamaica. Only authorized taxis with
                red license plates should be used by tourists. Advance fare negotiations are advised, and visitors
                should confirm the fare before starting the trip.
            </li>
