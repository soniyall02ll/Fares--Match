                <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/singapore-airlines.aspx">Singapore Airlines</a>, known throughout the world for its excellent in-flight services, symbolized by the Singapore Girl, is the flag carrier of the Republic of Singapore. The company's hub is located at Changi Airport, Singapore. Passengers traveling on any of their flights can be assured of their above-par hospitality. Singapore's first class is world-famous, but their economy class is also comfortable for passengers looking for budget-friendly travel. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">To book this Airline Flight, one has to check the company's official website and do the following: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the departing and arriving airports. </li>
                    <li>Select date. </li>
                </ol>

                <p class="text-justify">Singapore Airlines has a fleet of 148 Airbus and Boening and freight aircraft. This company has several subsidiaries, including an engineering company- SIA engineering company, which looks over the maintenance wing of the company. Singapore Airlines also has a low-cost carrier– Scoot, known for its <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">cheap flight reservations</a>. </p>

                <h2>Singapore Airlines first class 777</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Singapore Airlines' first-class experience starts from something other than the aircraft. It starts from the moment a passenger has checked their bags. The first-class lounge of Singapore Airlines has facilities ranging from plus armchairs to a magazine shelf with hundreds of modern titles. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">There is a top-class dining facility for passengers to enjoy. The Private Room is a lounge within the lounge. First, a passenger walks into the Silverkris lounge at the Changi airport. Then the staff takes the passenger to the first-class lounge, whose facilities are available to Singapore Airlines' Solitaire PPS Club members and Star Alliance first-class passengers. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Singapore Airlines' fleet is mainly composed of Boeing 777 aircraft. Below are the things which a passenger may expect on a Singapore Airlines first-class 777 flight: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Boarding the flight, a passenger will be ushered to their first-class cabin. The seats are lavish and hand-stitched—a hue of pink lights the cabin. A large IFE screen in the cabin faces the seat for entertainment purposes. </li>
                    <li>The interior decorators famously designed the cabin at BMW, but the company's branding is nowhere to be seen. Below the large screen is an ottoman which is also hand-stitched. </li>
                    <li>Besides, the ottoman is a compartment for storage. The screen is flanked by a door that hides a mirror. Under the IFE screen is a table that extends with the push of a button. </li>
                    <li>The side of the seat shell has several buttons to adjust seat angle, footrest extension and angle, mood lighting, and a button to call cabin crew. </li>
                    <li>On either side of the seat are reading lights and a headphone holder. A compartment accommodating 2 USB ports and an iPod socket is on the window side. </li>
                    <li>Two lavatories for four passengers. Singapore Airlines also provides amenity kits for first-class passengers, including Lalique-branded aftershave lotion, Eau de Toilette, slippers, and pajamas. </li>
                    <li>The seats fold out to form a makeshift yet comfortable bed. The cabin is not closable by a door, but the seats extend enough to provide privacy.      </li>
                </ol>


                <h3>Singapore Airlines first class review </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The first-class cabin of Singapore Airlines is lauded as the best in the industry. Skytrax has cited that Singapore Airlines has been the worlds best for four years. Passengers can travel satisfactorily for a lavishly comfortable yet a little on the expensive side. The cabin crew was also called by Skytrax one of the best in the world with their iconic Singapore Girl. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/first-class-suites-in-singapore-airlines.aspx">Singapore Airlines suites</a> are known throughout the world for the features it offers and also because of the in-flight hospitality. The Singapore Airlines first class review, in a tabulated form, is given below: </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The hand-stitched leather, soft seats with cushions, and a comforter mean that passengers can sleep peacefully. </li>
                    <li>The extensive infotainment system provided allows passengers to watch their favorite shows. This is a welcome addition for those who love films. </li>
                    <li>The amenities kit, Lalique-branded, has premium cosmetics for the benefit of the passengers. Commonly, they contain lip balms and shaving foams. </li>
                    <li>USB, HDMI, and iPod sockets, present in the cabin, stable output electricity to charge up one's devices. This is particularly useful for those in managerial positions who work around the clock. </li>
                    <li>The excellent in-flight food, complete with a selection of fine liquor, from smooth malted whiskey to champagne, provides a palatable experience. </li>
                    <li>The seat, which also becomes a bed with reading lights on either side of the headrest, is a splendid proposition for most passengers. </li>
                    <li>And last but not least, Singapore Airlines' cabin crew. They are the best in the world- polite, humble, and, if anyone is lonely, even friendly!    </li>
                </ol>
