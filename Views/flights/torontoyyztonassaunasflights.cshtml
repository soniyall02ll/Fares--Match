            <p class="text-justify">Nassau is one of the most populated and influential cities in the Bahamas. As the capital of the archipelago nation, it is the beating pulse of administration and law in the country. It is also the country’s leading centre of commerce, media, and education. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">With most of the country’s population living in the city, Nassau is considered the most essential part of the country. The town had been a point of conflict between the Spanish and the British crowns ever since permanent European settlement existed in the country in the seventeenth century. During the early days, the Spanish successfully raided the previous British settlement in that area known as Charles Town. Control of the city continued to be the point of contention, and this provided a golden opportunity for pirates. Soon, the area became known as a stronghold of mercenaries and outlaws who frequently used it as a harbour and defence point for their ships. The island’s natural assets, such as abundant food and suitable waterways, made it an incredible possession. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">In the eighteenth century, piracy was significantly reduced due to the renewed efforts of the British government. During the American War of Independence, the economic and social situation of the island greatly improved due to the improvement in funds available. The city continued to develop with the arrival of loyalists who supported the British cause during the war and resettled on these lands when they were forced to leave the newly independent United States of America. To get cheap <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>flight tickets</b></a> to Nassau, travellers should try to get tickets during the low season in autumn, as there are far fewer tourists visiting the city than usual, and consequently, prices are also lower than average. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The best time to get tickets on Toronto to Nassau flights is in the cooler seasons of winter and spring.
