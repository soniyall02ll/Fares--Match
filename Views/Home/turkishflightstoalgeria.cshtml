            <p>Algeria is an important country located in the Maghreb region in the northern part of the African continent on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The country shares borders with Tunisia to the northeast, Libya to the east, Niger to the southeast, Mali, Mauritania and Western Sahara to the southwest, and Morocco to the west. </p>
            <p>The country plays an important role in the continent as the largest nation in terms of size, one of the largest economies, one of the most populous countries, and possesses the largest and most technologically advanced militaries of the continent. This economic development has prompted many travellers to get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-deals.aspx"><b>flight deals</b></a> to it to attend business and official matters here. </p>
            <h2>Algeria – By The People And For The People</h2>
            <p>Algeria is made up of vast tracts of the arid Sahara desert with little fertile zones in the mountainous northern part of the country which is also home to most of the population. The official languages of the country are Arabic and Tamazight with French being commonly understood and the Algerian dialect of Arabic being the most widely spoken. </p>
            <p>The economy of the country is greatly dependent on revenues earned from the hydrocarbon industry with oil and natural gas forming its primary pillars. The tourism industry of the country has managed to develop despite early setbacks due to a lack of infrastructure with the growing popularity of several United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Sites with most being artificial. This has prompted reservations for many direct flights to the country. </p>
            <p>The climate of the country is generally hot and dry as a result of the hot desert located in the southern part of the country with precipitation being concentrated in the region between the coastal plains and the parallel ranges of Tell Atlas and Sahara Atlas. Other mountain ranges include the Hoggar Mountains in the south and Aures and Nememcha mountain ranges in the northeastern region. </p>
            <p>The desert region of the country sees vegetation and fauna typical of desert grassland regions amid sand dunes and an extreme diurnal range of temperature as a result of its inland location. The mountainous regions while cooler have sand dunes between them. The coastal regions too experience the moderating effect of the sea but remain warm throughout the year. </p>
            <h2>Airports of Algeria </h2>
            <p>The most important airport of Algeria is the Houari Boumediene International Airport which is located in the Dar El–Beida region of the Sidi M’hamed district of Algiers province at a distance of over sixteen kilometers or over ten miles from Algiers, the capital city of the country. The airport, known to many travellers as the Algiers Airport or the Algiers International Airport provides services to over seven million passengers travelling to and from the city every year. </p>
            <p>Another important airport of the country is the Ahmed Ben Bella Airport which is located at a distance of over eleven kilometres or seven miles in the southern direction from the city of Oran in the Oran province of the Oran district in the northwestern part of the country. The airport, once known as the Es Sénia Airport, provides services to over one million passengers travelling to and from the city every year. </p>
            <h2>Turkish Airlines – The Pride of Turkey</h2>
            <p>Turkish Airlines is one of the most well-known airlines in the world as the Turkish flag carrier and one of the best-rated airlines in the world. Reservations can be easily made by travellers through the official website of the airline and the Turkish Airlines Flight Ticket app. </p>
            <p>The headquarters of Turkish Airlines is located in the Atartürk Airport in the city of Istanbul in the country of Turkey. The building is located in the Yesilkoy neighbourhood of the Bakirköy municipality of the city. The many subsidiaries of Turkish Airlines which greatly benefit the airlines are Air Albania Airlines, the AJet, the SunExpress THY OPET, the Turkish Engine Centre, TSI Aviation Seats and Turkish Cargo. </p>
            <h2>A Tour Plan Of Algeria</h2>
            <p>Travellers currently in the process of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>flight booking</b></a> should formulate a proper plan regarding what area they want to visit and how much time they wish to allocate for the trip. An example is given below outlining what a tour of Algeria can look like. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Travellers will probably get a flight to the capital city of the country and should take the first few days to visit the beautiful tourist destinations of Algiers. The largest city of the country is home to the Algiers Post Office, Ketchaoua Mosque, Martyr’s Monument, Kasbah, Djamaa El Djazaïr, Bardo Museum, Djamaa El Djedid and Notre Dame D’Afrique.
                <li>
                <li>Travellers should then proceed to the part of the Sahara Desert located in the country to appreciate the deadly sandy beauty of the hot desert, the dizzying height of Mount Tahat and the pleasing greenery of the Atlas ranges. </li></ul>
