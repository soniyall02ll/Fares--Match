                <h3>Booking secrets of British Airways</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Below are some tips and secrets you must use during your British Airways booking next time to save some amount in your pocket. </p>

                <h4>Make sure to collect Avios</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">One of the best tricks to get the cheapest British Airway flight fares is to collect Avios and use them in whole or part towards the airfare. Avios is usually the air miles program of which British Airways are part. Once you successfully open a free B.A. Executive Club account by giving your unique B.A. Executive account number, you're ready to start collecting Avios. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Avios is not only earned when you fly, but you can also collect Avios through various ways such as shopping online, grocery shopping, staying in hotels, and lots more. Avios can proliferate if you are a wise spender. You can easily collect 100,000 Avios a year which is almost enough for a return <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/jetblue-flights-to-new-york.aspx">Business Class flight to New York</a>. Even when you redeem Avios for a free flight, you must pay the taxes and fees. The amount depends on the flight, the destination, and the cabin class. </p>

                <h4>Look out for sales</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">The most obvious way of finding <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/british-airways-cheapest-flight-deals.aspx">cheap British Airways flight tickets</a> is to book them during one of the popular sales announced by the airline. Some travelers are there who wait only to buy during a sale, which happens a few times every year, and only ever pay the sale price for their flights. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">It has been shown that in the U.K., one of the most popular times for booking holidays is during the first week of January. The reason is that Christmas is finished, the holidays get over, and people head back to work. If you book an entire holiday with the airline, you will save on the flight and the hotel, and you can even hire a car too. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The best way to stay on top of British Airways sales is by regularly visiting the airline's website, where you will find information on all the sales happening. You can also join the British Airlines newsletter and become a free British Airways Executive account member. </p>

                <h4>Booking as early as possible</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">In most cases, the earlier you try to book your flight, the cheaper you will get it. If the demand for the flight is not as high as the airways had expected, automatic pricing kicks in, and the price gets reduced to meet the demand. At the same time, a sale could push the price down further. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The worst thing you can do is book a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/last-minute-deals.aspx">last-minute flight</a> as these are almost always more expensive, especially if you are flying in Business Class or First. Hence it is always the best option to book your flight at least 8 weeks in advance and during a sale which will give you the best opportunities for a cheap British Airways flight. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Hence in the following ways, you can manage to fly on British Airways at the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">cheapest deals</a>. It is not necessary for you to be a regular business flyer to make those same savings. It helps, but other methods and ways have been mentioned above to reduce your flight costs. Therefore the most important thing is to stay active on the airline's website. </p>
