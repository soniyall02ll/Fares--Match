Regardless of whether one is visiting for business, pleasure, or family, that person would be visiting an adventure-packed city with plenty to explore. There is a blend of cultural spaces, outdoor activities, and an exciting mix of ancient and contemporary sites.</p>
            <p>FaresMatch is just your travel site for cheap flights and hotel accommodations; it offers you maximum value in your travel. So let’s start talking about what makes Cleveland such a cool place to visit and tips on how to <b>travel from Tampa to CLE</b> on a budget.</p>

            <h2>Cleveland’s Rich Cultural Heritage and Iconic Landmarks</h2>
            <p>To be honest, Cleveland may not always be a top tourist destination, but the fact is that this city has plenty of history as well as culture; it has become quite a hidden gem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure to include this one in your itinerary: The Rock Hall, one of its iconic museums dedicated to the history of rock music. Well, musically, it’s worth a visit by music fans, as it contains the artefacts of legendary artists and displays memorials and even interactive exhibits about them. Similarly, you can hear live venues with up-and-coming local artists who play their tunes.</li>
                <li>For art lovers, the Art Museum is one of the most distinguished art museums in America. It contains an incredible collection of works from around the globe. It’s pretty much open to the public and thus can become one of the very finest places to visit on a budget. Nestled next to the museum is the Cleveland Botanical Garden, offering that much-needed escape from the city with its beautiful green gardens and seasonal events.</li>
                <li>For those who want a taste of history, head straight to the Cleveland History Centre. It is in the heart of the city and tells the tale of Cleveland’s industrial past, showing famous artefacts from well-known Clevelanders.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Relish Outdoor Adventure in Cleveland’s Lakeside Beauty</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cleveland boasts cultural attractions, but it’s also packed with lots of outdoor space, especially along Lake Erie. It also has Edgewater Park, the area at the city waterfront with panoramic views of the lake for visitors interested in taking walks along the beach or even paddleboarding. </li>
                <li>Great Space Park Green Lands are another good place for picnicking, biking, or just relaxing in the water.</li>
                <li>Cleveland, however, boasts much more than that by providing access to more than 23,000 acres of parkland by the Cleveland Metroparks system. Their endless number of sprawling parks provide an array of activities like hiking, biking, and birdwatching. </li>
                <li>Cleveland Lakefront Nature Preserve is perfect for nature lovers, as it walks through wetlands and forests, getting eyes on migratory birds. </li>
                <li>For those inclined toward more strenuous activities, several beautiful trails winding through areas of thick forests provide for both challenging and easy hikes.</li>
                <li>Golf lovers will start to find many golf courses and several within the Metroparks. Cleveland is not lacking in what would make an ideal setting for great outdoor adventure locales, from beautiful lakeside views and wooded trails to wide-open spaces.</li>
            </ul>
