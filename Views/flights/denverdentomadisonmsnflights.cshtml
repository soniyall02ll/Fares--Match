            <h2>Touring Madison: City of Lakes and Culture </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Madison is situated between Lake Mendota and Lake Monona, and it brings together the two most beautiful worlds of nature and culture. Begin your journey through the beautiful State Capitol, architecturally the stunning seat of Wisconsin's government and later go on the way through the kaleidoscopic ambience created by farmers' markets and local shopping spots.</li>
                <li>Walk down the mile-long State Street, packed with quirky boutique shops, cafes, and restaurants, but visit Mother Earth at the Olbrich Botanical Gardens which serves great views and one of the most remarkable Thai Pavilions. If you're lucky enough to go in summer, don't forget to get out to kayak or paddleboard on the peaceful lakes that dot this idyllic city. </li>
                <li>Madison, of course, devotes an entire section of itself to foodies-in-the-garden with floor-to-ceiling farm-to-table dining and a few craft breweries.

            <ul>
                <li>Discover Denver Art Museum for its contemporary as well as indigenous collections while the newly added RiNo (River North) features bright murals and hot breweries. Catch a game at either Coors Field or Empower Field at Mile High using these venues.</li>
                <li>The most sought-after feature is culinary culture—from farm-table restaurants to rooftop food halls of course, like the Denver Central Market. Such gardens and nearby parks create spaces for day trips into the Rockies, to bask in stunning views as one goes.</li>
