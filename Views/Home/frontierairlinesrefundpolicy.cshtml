Frontier Airlines' refund procedure states that you can request a refund itself through the customer care department or its government websites.

            <h3>When can I request to obtain a refund? When should I anticipate it? </h3>
            <p>We must first cancel their ticket before requesting a refund. If you cancel your flight within 24 hours of booking your reservation and the travel is at least 7 weeks away, Frontier Airlines would honor your refund application. </p>

            <h3>Is it possible to seek compensation if the flight is postponed by two hours? </h3>

If your flight is delayed for much less than 24 hours, customers are guaranteed meals plus beverages at the airport, according to the DGCA.
