                Traveling to a new country can create a lot of questions from how to travel to how to return. If you are planning a trip to Greece, you should know almost everything about it right from how to start. If you're flying from the United States to Greece, you'll land at one of two airports: Thessaloniki Airport Makedonia (SKG) serves the greater metropolitan area of Greece's second-largest city in the north. The capital, the Peloponnese, and the Aegean Sea islands in the south are served by Eleftherios Venizelos Airport (ATH), or Athens Airport. You will not need a visa to enter Greece if you hold a US passport or are a citizen of one of the Schengen countries, and you will be able to stay in the country for up to 90 days from the date of admission. You can apply for an iVisa online if you are from a nation that requires one.

Ancient archaeological sites, sandy beaches, numerous islands, and a pleasant Mediterranean environment are just a few of the things to enjoy and explore in the country. The historic buildings of Athens, ancient Delphi, and the monasteries of Meteora are among the top things to see on the mainland, but most visitors come to catch a ferry to one of the islands, the most popular of which are Santorini, Rhodes, Mykonos, Crete, and Corfu. Greece provides a varied choice of fantastic dining alternatives in addition to gorgeous landscapes and historical attractions. </p>

                . The largest of the Greek islands, Crete, forms the country's southern border. The island's two international airports are Chania Souda on the island's western border and Heraklion Airport (HER) in the island's center. The settlements of Sitia and Zakros, on the island's eastern flank, are easily accessible from there. The Cyclades are a series of islands in the southern Aegean Sea that includes the well-known Mykonos, Thira (Santorini) islands, and Naxos. You can fly from Athens to
                Santorini International Airport (JTR) and continue from there, but most people choose to take the ferry from Piraeus in Athens.
