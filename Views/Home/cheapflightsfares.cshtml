                <h2 class="text-justify">Cheap + Flights + Fares</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">A). Cheap Means Economical</p>
                <p class="text-justify">B). Economical Deals for Flights</p>
                <p class="text-justify">C). Fares are about the purchase price on the flight tickets</p>

Well, passengers can fly for free when they become frequent flyer programs of any airline.  </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Once you join the airline's frequent flyer program, then whenever you purchase the tickets from the airline's official site or your travel agent, you will be able to add reward points to your wallet.
