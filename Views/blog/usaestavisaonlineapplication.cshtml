            <h2>What is ESTA</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) is an automated system that evaluates whether visitors are eligible to travel to the US under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). The ESTA authorization does not determine whether or not a traveler is accepted to the US. Upon arrival, officers from the United States Customs and Border Protection determine admissibility. The ESTA application requests biographic data as well as responses to VWP eligibility questions. This application can be submitted at any time before travel, however, it is encouraged that travelers apply as soon as they start planning their trip or purchase airline tickets. It allows you to visit the United States for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, as long as it's for a vacation or business trip. All nationals of visa-waiver nations, including the United Kingdom, are eligible for this. </p>

            <h3>Requirement for ESTA Visa online application is approved when</h3>


            <ul>
                <li>You're a British citizen or a citizen of another visa-exempt country who is visiting the United States. </li>
                <li>Your journey will last no more than 90 days and will be either for business or pleasure. </li>
                <li>If you're driving into the US from Mexico or Canada, you don't need an ESTA because you'll be coming by plane or cruise ship. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-justify">Note: Make sure you hold a Valid Passport for the same. You should also pre-learn the travel guideline in the USA. </p>

            <h4>Step-by-step guide on how to apply for ESTA Visa</h4>


            <h2 class="text-justify">Start your application by filling out Personal Information</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">By clicking the <b>"Apply for ESTA"</b> button, you'll be sent to the application page. You'll be presented with several forms to fill out after you've arrived at the application page. Make sure you complete all the fields in English. Any fields highlighted with a red asterisk* are required to be completed. The first section of the form asks for personal information. You'll need to provide your name, surname (Family Name), gender, date of birth, birthplace, and parents' names, along with contact details and address. After that, you'll need to fill out the information about your job, and if you want, you may also include information about your social network accounts. The employment information is required on the form to guarantee that you are not illegally entering the United States to work. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Further, your emergency contact information will need to be filled in. This is someone who can be reached in the event of an emergency. After that, you'll be asked to fill out some information about your vacation intentions. Next, you'll have to fill up your passport information. This is required since it will be used to verify that your identification matches that of your ESTA visa application when you fly. Now comes the eligibility questions which include questions to know if you have any diseases or have committed any crime before. You should fill it correctly, failure to which can make you resubmit your form. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Completing and reviewing your form</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">You will be presented with a summary of all of your information when you have finished with all the forms. Now is the moment to double-check that all the data you submitted was right. Remember, you won't be able to edit any of this information once your application has been submitted and approved, so double-check it now. If you provide incorrect information, you will have to reapply. Note, the "confirm your information" message will appear at the bottom of the page; read it over and check it before proceeding. Your application will need to be re-submitted if your information is inaccurate after this stage. You'll be directed to a payment screen when you've confirmed your details. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Payment information</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">Now you will be required to fill out your card information on this page. Here you need to fill out the card number, expiry date, and others asked questions to make the payment for the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/usa-esta-visa-online-application.aspx">ESTA application process</a>. Once you submit it and make the payment, you are all done. Also, remember to keep an eye on your application status thereafter. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Major Points to remember</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Official guidelines state that you must submit your application at least 72 hours before your trip. Remember that you'll need an ESTA even if you're changing planes in America. </li>

                <li>Apply for an ESTA visa online at the official ESTA website. Allow up to 72 hours for a response, while your ESTA application process may be handled right away. </li>

                <li>Make a note of the application number, so you can monitor the progress of your ESTA visa application or make changes to your information. </li>

                <li>Make your ESTA payment — it costs $14 to do so directly through the ESTA website right now. If you <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/faq/how-to-book-flight-ticket-online.aspx">book</a> through a<a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"> travel agent</a>, you'll almost certainly pay extra. You will only be charged $4 if you are denied entry to the United States. </li>

                <li>Check the status of your application - once approved, your ESTA is valid for two years, and you can return to America as many times as you like without having to reapply. </li>

                <li>You won't need to print or bring your ESTA information with you when you travel because it will be emailed to your <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/major-airlines.aspx">airline automatically</a>.</li>

                <li>It's up to you whether you use the ESTA system to update your travel details for future journeys. </li>

                <li>An ESTA is good for two years or until the expiration of your passport, whichever comes first. If you received an ESTA for a trip to the United States less than two years ago and then renewed your passport, you'll need to reapply. </li>

                <li>Remember, you'll need to apply for a new ESTA when your old one expires. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Final Words</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">Lastly, we would like you to know some vital information about the ESTA application process. You must provide transit or return ticket upon arrival to verify that you intend to leave the United States shortly. If you are planning a trip to Alaska, the American Virgin Islands, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Northern Mariana Islands, you will need to apply for it. Additionally, if you have a valid ESTA for a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/us-travel-news.aspx">US travel</a> visa, Homeland Security may prohibit your entrance into the United States at any moment if you are suspected of endangering public order and safety. Travelers who visited Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, or Somalia after March 10, 2011, or who have ever been a national of one of these countries, are not eligible for an ESTA. </p>
