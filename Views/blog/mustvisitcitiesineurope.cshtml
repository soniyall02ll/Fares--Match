                <h2>Hacking Your Europe Trip</h2>

                <p>Europe is a very complicated continent to work through. Although the cities of this continent are very beautiful each city has a different culture, language, and way of life according to their countries. So you must know of a few tricks to know when in Europe-</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be Alert when you are traveling across the cities like Paris as there are just so many pickpockets and scammers. Do not give your phone to anyone to click a photo. Carry all your identity info in a fanny pack close to your body.</li>
                    <li>Carry enough winter clothes. If you are traveling from countries of Asia then you would feel quite cold when exploring through these cities. So carry some winter clothes just in case.</li>
                    <li>Use a translator app. Not all of Europe speaks English. So carrying a translator app will be a lifesaver for you.</li>
                    <li>Calculate currency well before spending. If you do not do that then you might just spend way out of your budget and put yourself in a difficult position.</li>
                </ol>
