                    <li>Spend the evening on the beach dining by sunset at Passions on the Beach or Barefoot while the waves soundtrack intimacy. Visit the natural pool, which is a secluded swimming spot bordered by volcanic rock, for a unique experience. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Richly furnished boutique resorts like Silversands Grenada and Laluna offer areas of beach-secluded relaxation combined with world-class services. </li>
                    <li>Knock up a romance by visiting the Underwater Sculpture Park to snorkel without being immersed too much in water while combining art with marine life. </li>
                    <li>Adventure could perhaps be derived from diving into the lush rainforest, and visiting waterfalls such as Annandale Falls. Take your senses and indulge in a very rich organic cocoa experience and sample some of the stash by going on a chocolate tour at a local plantation. </li>
                    <li>Most certainly visit Grand Anse Beach, which is perhaps the nicest stretch of sand in the Caribbean. Set the evening mood and indulge in a dinner for two, spiced with the island’s aromatic spices, as the sun sets.</li>
