            <h2>What is the seating facility of Allegiant airlines?</h2>
            <p>Allegiant Air makes flying an easy, cheap experience by offering simple and comfortable seating.  The airline prioritizes comfort and flexibility within a streamlined framework that enables travellers to tailor their trip according to their preferences and budget, even if customers may not find luxury-tier facilities aboard.</p>
            <h3>Standard Seating</h3>
            <p>Allegiant Air features standard leather seats in every <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-deals.aspx"><b>flight deals</b></a> to ensure customers can enjoy some comfort at a decent cost. On most of the airlines’ fleet—composed largely of Airbus A319 and A320s—these seats are configured 3-3 across the cabin. Seat pitch in the regular section aboard low-cost carriers generally gives a standard amount of legroom, about 30 inches. Depending on how far you’re traveling, the seats may be a little snug, but these airlines are good for short-medium distance flights.</p>
            <p>Travelers who don’t get a seat assignment when they book will have a seat assigned to them randomly at check-in. If you are a solo traveller and want to adjust your seat at any time, this is your cheapest choice.</p>
            <h3>Upgraded Seating Options</h3>
            <p>If you want a little extra space, Allegiant provides upgraded seats with extra legroom. You’ll find these in the first rows and sometimes in the exit rows. You’ll find a 34-inch seat pitch on extra legroom seats which helps taller passengers or anyone who wants extra space feel more comfortable. At booking or check-in, passengers may choose to pay extra for these seats. After a boarding pass has been issued, you can’t swap seats at the airport, so those who prefer a specific seat should plan ahead.</p>
            <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
            <p>Because there is neither reclining service nor Wi-Fi and entertainment on Allegiant flights, the lack of complication makes checking in and boarding swift and easy. Only things you choose such as a special seat, carry-on baggage or priority boarding, will be charged when you fly.</p>

            <h2>Why passengers should choose Allegiant Air for Concord Trip?</h2>
