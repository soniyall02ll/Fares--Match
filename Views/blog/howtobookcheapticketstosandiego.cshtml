                            <h2>How to get cheap tickets according to travel agents? </h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Below are some valuable tips on getting more for money in terms of flights ticket and the best way to book flight tickets per travel agents' suggestions. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-justify">Booking flights during working weekends</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Booking your flight during the working week can save you money since flight prices for departures during the week, especially Tuesdays and Wednesdays, are much lower. The reason why tickets are mainly cheap these days is that these days are less popular to travel on. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-justify">Take a look at various airline websites</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Most airline websites have made it simpler to identify inexpensive days to fly with the feature of displaying a calendar view booking system. This system allows passengers to scan prices across the week you are looking for and then choose the one that is the best for them. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-justify">Consider your time of departure on the day you book your flight</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">There are chances for you to get a bargain flight if you are ready to fly at an early hour. Tickets might be less expensive when you decide to fly at 6 am than at later times due to that time being less popular. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-justify">You can also get cheap flights tickets by using package holidays</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">You can always book a package holiday to get discounts on flights and accommodation. The reason is that travel company book tickets in such large amounts that they get huge discounts. Most of the time, it is also possible to get a whole holiday lower than the price of a regular flight. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-justify">Looking for tickets by going incognito</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">During the searching process, stay unidentified, as this can be one of the most important aspects of getting cheap flight tickets. Flight ticket prices vary depending on the demand, which implies that airlines use the data of the number of people searching for and buying particular tickets to calculate their prices. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">For this, you may need to find that when you have shown an interest in a particular flight and have been checking it, the ticket price is increasing continuously. The reason is that the airline knows that you are likely to buy it and are intent on making more money from you. To prevent this, delete your cookies and see what happens to the price once your browser history has been cleared. </p>
