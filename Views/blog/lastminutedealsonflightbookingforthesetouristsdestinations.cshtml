                            <h3>Croatia</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">You need to be flexible if you want to change your reservation by a day or more. You may be able to find a cheaper rate as well. Be flexible with the type of bed and the type of room provided. Being flexible gives the hotel a larger price range than it can offer. You can check for cheap hotels at Hotel Tonight, Hotwire, Expedia, and many more. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">To get a last-minute flight to Croatia is to check<a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"> cheap plane tickets</a> on various apps like Sky Scanner, Google Flight, and many more.

                            <h3>New York</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">To get the best last-minute booking hotels in New York, try to search using Google Hotel Search to compare prices across the booking sites. This will give you an easy win. You can also book using the company's app. </p>

                            <h3>The Caribbean</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Priceline, Hotwire, and others keep the name of the hotel a secret unless you book it. A lot of money can be saved by booking a secret hotel. But this makes a lot of people nervous as they do not have any idea what hotel they are going to get. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Some of the last-minute hotel deals in the Caribbean are Dreams Royal Beach Punta Cana which has a price of 20,957. The Majestic Elegance Punta Cana is worth rupees 26,543. </p>

Use flight finder apps like Sky Scanner, Google Flight, and Hopper to look for last-minute cheap air tickets. Sometimes the price of a flight will drop in advance. So, it is better to sign up for price alerts and newsletters. </p>

                            <h3>Alaska</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">To get last-minute hotels in Alaska, you can use Google Hotel Search to compare the prices across all the booking sites. A lot of hotels are there that do not have a name of recognition like other brands. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Faresmatch is the quickest way to search for flight tickets as they compare the prices of direct airlines and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/last-minute-deals-on-flight-booking-for-these-tourists-destinations.aspx">third-party booking sites</a> within seconds. </p>
