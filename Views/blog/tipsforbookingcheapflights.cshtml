                <p>Low-cost airlines are considered one of the most popular ways for travellers to cut costs when they decide to take a flight to any location of their choice. This kind of airline is known all over the world by a vast variety of names including no-frills, budget carriers, discount carriers, discount airlines and low-cost air carriers.</p>

                <p>Low-cost airlines generally follow a simple model to cut costs and that is to minimize operating costs of the airlines by reducing many of the services standard airlines provide. These services are generally paid for by the ticket fares of these airlines causing the price to rise significantly but low-cost airlines make them optional. These fees, known as add-on fees, are paid by the customer if they wish to avail of the service allowing the airlines to provide <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-flights.aspx"><b>cheap flights</b></a> to all its customers.</p>

                <p>Some services for which additional fees may be charged are additional baggage, in-flight meals and in-flight internet connection. This model has become extremely popular in the last few years due to the greater autonomy afforded to the traveller.</p>

                <h2>Deals and Discounts</h2>

                <p>Deals and discounts are another popular method that travellers employ to keep their trip within their budget. The most important aspect of this trick is planning. Travellers must carefully plan their trip and sort out details such as – when they intend to visit their destination and how long they intend to stay there.</p>

                <p>The reason why planning is important to travellers is because timing is crucial if they intend to take advantage of deals. For example, many locations around the world offer special discounts during festivals and holidays as a way to spread the celebratory spirit of the time and attract more travellers to take an interest in their culture.</p>

                <p>Other popular discounts which travellers can look out for during the process of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>flight ticket booking</b></a> are family and couple discounts. While couple discounts are a staple of any popular honeymoon destination such as beach towns, family discounts are also frequently offered by travellers to help ease the burden shouldered during a family trip which requires many tickets at once.</p>

                <h2>Frequent Flyer Programs</h2>

                <p>Frequent flyer programs are yet another method used by travellers to avoid an excessive strain on their pockets as a result of the high prices of flight tickets. This is an especially popular method if you need <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/last-minute-flights.aspx"><b>last-minute flights</b></a> due to a family emergency a sudden business meeting or even a spontaneous weekend vacation.</p>

                <p>A frequent flyer program is also known as a loyalty program for an airline. The program works by allowing travellers to earn extra miles and special privileges for each trip they take. These miles allow travellers to be eligible for several special rewards such as an exclusive lounge and waiting area and extra baggage for free.</p>

                <p>In most flights, the mileage earned can easily be transferred to any other airline which is part of an alliance with the initial airlines. In some airlines, there is an additional provision allowing travellers to gift or transfer the miles they have earned so that their friend or family member can reap the benefits they may not be able to enjoy at that moment.</p>
