            <p class="text-justify">Attention all new and old flyers of the United Airlines because here we are going to disclose a full-fledged review of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx">United Airlines Baggage Policy</a> that you can’t miss as a traveler. Every different fare class comes with different rules and terms of the baggage policy.

            <h2 class="text-justify">Try to Avoid Lithium Batteries Installed Bags: </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">United Airlines is not expecting bags in which passengers installed any kind of lithium batteries in both carry-on and checked bags. You must remove lithium batteries from your bags if you want to board for the flight. Smart bags are also the big hurdle for the flyers to travel in United Air because smart bags in which the battery is not removable are not allowed in United and United Express Flights. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Many different questions came into the mind of flyers because they are still confused about the carry-on baggage policy of the airline. Here are few common questions in the mind of flyers about the United Baggage policy</p>
            <p class="text-justify">1). What is the exact size or dimensions allowed in a united carry-on? </p>
            <p class="text-justify">2). is a golf umbrella counted as a carry-on item during onboard? </p>
            <p class="text-justify">3). Will my laptop is counted as a personal item in United Baggage Policy? </p>
            <p class="text-justify">We are come here to give answers to all major questions about United Carry-On Baggage Policy and the United Airlines Checked Baggage Policy. In most of the fare classes of United Air, passengers are allowed to carry one personal item and one full-size carry-on bag onboard. Sometimes, basic economy tickets rules are different from the first class and business class. If you do not want to face baggage-related problems on board then make sure the dimensions and weight of your baggage are according to the airline baggage policy. Passenger carry-on luggage must fit in the overhead bin space in the United Airlines (otherwise, it will count as the checked bag). </p>
            <h2 class="text-justify">What You Can Bring On Board in United Airlines Flights? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">1). One carry-on bag and one personal item is allowed on board in almost all fare classes of United Airlines(however you should also read exception too before flying). </p>
            <p class="text-justify">2). No doubt, the carry-on bag must fit in the overhead bin space and the maximum allowed dimensions of a carry-on bag in the United Air are 9 inches x 14 inches x 22 inches (22 centimeters x 35 centimeters x 56 centimeters). These dimensions also include the wheels and handles of your bag. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">3). Personal items should fit underneath the seat in front of passengers and passengers should also follow the dimensions rules for the personal item too and that is 9 inches x 10 inches x 17 inches (22 centimeters x 25 centimeters x 43 centimeters). </p>
            <p class="text-justify">4). If you are not carrying both personal items and carry-on items then you can also bring some special items without any baggage fee and these items are: </p>
