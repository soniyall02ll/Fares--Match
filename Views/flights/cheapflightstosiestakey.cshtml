            <h2>Flight Charges </h2>

            <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>

                <li>The best period from March to May is warm and there are not many people. This period is very suitable for going to the beaches and participating in other recreational activities since the temperature averages from 70 degrees to 85 degrees. </li>
