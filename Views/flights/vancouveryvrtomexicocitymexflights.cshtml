            <p class="text-justify">Mexico City is one of the world’s leading centres of culture and finance. As the Mexican capital, it has been the country’s administrative centre for centuries. The city has remarkably managed to maintain its importance and thus plays a pivotal role in both national and international politics. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The city is highly populated and urbanized to provide all modern amenities. It is mainly well known for the multiple progressive and inclusionary laws that are in force within its boundaries. Located in the beautiful Valley of Mexico, the city is surrounded by magnificent mountains and dormant volcanoes. The area was once home to the Teochichimeca people, who raised the Toltec and Mexica cultures in the due course of time. Of them, the Mexica, better known as the Aztecs, built one of the greatest ancient cities in North America, the Mexico – Tenochtitlan. They believed the land to be hallowed ground, a sacred gift from their sun God, Huitzilopochtli. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The city’s magnificence was lost soon after the arrival of European settlers. Spanish powers subdued the local community through methods such as brutal conquest and colonialism.

The country finally achieved its freedom from the Spanish crown. It slowly developed into the unique nation that we know today.
