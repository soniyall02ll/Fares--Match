            <h2>How to plan your Toronto Visit?</h2>

            <p>It is just a short distance so you can book a short flight or Board an <b>Ottawa to Toronto train</b> easily and reach Toronto. Check in to your hotel and take the help of this short tour plan provided by <b>Faresmatch</b> to explore:</p>

            <p><b>Day 1:</b> Start with a hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate. Go to the Distillery Area and explore the place by walking. Go to the Royal Ontario Museum in the afternoon to get acquainted with the historical and cultural background of the city. The Toronto Harbourfront has incredible views of Lake Ontario, so get out for a walk there in the evening.</p>

            <p><b>Day 2:</b> Spend your second day in Niagara Falls. Would you like to be wet and enjoy the view from behind the Niagara Falls? Take the Journey Behind the Falls tour or take a helicopter tour to enjoy the airborne view. Later in the day, return to Toronto.</p>

            <p><b>Day 3:</b> Begin your day with a trip to the Toronto Christmas Market held at the Distillery District. If you still have not made your plans on what to do during this winter, you should check out Nathan Phillips Square and get a chance to ice skate at the top ice, rink located at the Toronto City Hall. Finish the tour by visiting CN Tower and enjoy the scenery of a snowy city.</p>



            <h3>When to visit Toronto?</h3>

            <p>The best time to visit Toronto is in early summer (May to June) and early autumn (September through October). There are fewer people, great weather, and active festivals for example the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Summer is ideal for outdoor entertainment and beach celebrations, however, vacationers flock in large numbers and everything is costly during this time. Winter (December-February) may be best for individuals who like celebrations related to the New Year and the Christmas tree but it is really cold.</p>
