                <p><b>Theme parks</b>- who doesn't like amusement parks? Whether you are a child or an adult, everyone gets excited after visiting a theme park. It is one of the perfect ways to spend time with your family and friends. Go on all the rides, try out the available foods, and have fun; let your inner child go crazy! </p>
                <p><b>Jungle safari</b>- If you are visiting a tropical country or a place mostly covered with jungle, safari is the perfect activity. Explore the wildlife and gain some knowledge about the habitants of the jungle. This is an excellent activity for children as they will experience how the animals look and live. There are a lot of luxury family vacation packages which include jungle safari. </p>
                <p><b>Getting a camel ride</b>- If you plan a vacation to the deserts, you cannot miss this opportunity to ride a camel! There are also other things you can try out in a desert: dunes driving or camping. Don't forget to pack warm summer clothes as the temperature varies day and night. </p>
                <p><b>Swimming with the dolphins</b>- Dolphins are considered one of the kindest creatures on this planet, and swimming with them can be a dream come true and a whole new experience. If you are visiting any beach countries, take advantage of this opportunity. </p>
                <p><b>Hiking</b>- If you are considering visiting a hilly place, then hiking is the best activity you can experience. Walk through the mountains and forests and get a hold of the beauty of nature. It is an incredible experience to have with your friends. </p>
                <p><b>Bungee jumping</b>- if you are not weak-hearted and easily scared, this daring activity is perfect for you. This might be a bit risky, but the experience is totally out of the world; you can measure your fear with the help of bungee jumping. Do not worry; there will be a trained person with you to supervise. </p>
