                <p class="text-justify">Costa Rica is a Central American country with a population of just over one million people. Nicaragua and Panama border it to the north and south, respectively. Costa is just a smidgeon bigger than West Virginia. The creation of national parks is dedicated to conserving the country's beauty and diversity. Forests cover nearly one-fifth of the country. The largest cloud forest in Central America is the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. Costa Rica has about 2,000 tree species and over 9,000 flowering plant species. Relaxing on the beach, either on the Pacific or Caribbean side, soaking in natural hot springs, a zip line 600 feet above the ground with volcano views, exploring the rainforest, or chasing waterfalls in Costa Rica might all be part of the ideal honeymoon. However, the place does have some best neighborhoods and you should book for those locations as well while making <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-flights-to-costa-rica.aspx">airlines reservations for Costa Rica</a>. Below are 6 places that are indeed checking out on your Costa Rica trip: </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Escazú</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Escazu, Costa Rica, is home to some of the best dining, shopping, and hotels in the country. Everything is easily accessible in Escazu, even golf courses, which are tucked away just a few kilometers from the main city. The Multiplaza Mall was the first large shopping center to bring together a variety of worldwide brands under one roof, and it's still a fun destination to browse and shop today, but another upscale shopping destination has sprung up to tempt tourists and locals: Escazu is an expatriate enclave affectionately referred to as the Beverly Hills of Costa Rica. Many airlines offer <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-tickets-booking.aspx">flight ticket booking</a> for this place for which you should follow Social Media posts because amazing offers always run there first. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Downtown</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">The central business district of San Jose, often known as "El Centro" or "Chepe," is mostly used for commerce and politics. Avenida Central is a pedestrian mall with retail businesses, hotels, and political offices that stretch out into the city. The city's cultural core in the downtown district, which houses the Gold, Jade, and National Museums, as well as the performing arts. Although a few stylish hotels surround Democracy Square, there are few places to stay.<a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-booking.aspx"> Delta airline bookings</a> to Downtown will not disappoint, as you will not only be surrounded by this fashionable area while on your trip, but you will also be flying in style with Delta. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Cartago</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Cartago's breathtakingly gorgeous riverfront setting was noted by the Spanish ruler in 1563, and it's easy to see why it was chosen as Costa Rica's first capital. The largest and highest active volcano in Costa Rica, Iraz, is located 19 kilometers northeast of Cartago and is called after the indigenous word ara-tzu, which means "thunder point." 15 additional eruptions have occurred since the town was devastated by a volcanic explosion in 1723, the most recent being in 1963. The Parque Nacional Volcán Iraz was established in 1955 to protect more than 2000 hectares of land surrounding the volcano. Its only buildings are a small information center and a café. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Puerto Jiménez</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">The biodiversity of its neighbor, the Corcovado National Park, the "crown gem" of Costa Rica's environmental reserves, dwarfs Puerto Jimenez's population of fewer than 2000 people. Among the more than 500 tree species, look for Scarlet Macaws and four other monkey species. The nightlife in Puerto Jimenez is about as laid-back as it gets in Costa Rica, except for the occasional full moon party or beach bonfire. Pull up to one of the roadside bars, remain for after-dinner cocktails at Il Giardino, or seek out the Pearl of the Osa at the Iguana Lodge, one of Puerto's most exciting spots, even though it closes at 9:00 p.m. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Turrialba</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Turrialba is a tiny agricultural town in Costa Rica's lush Central Valley, located 53 kilometers east of San Jose in the Cartago department. If you want to visit this place, we suggest you book Spirit Airlines <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/spirit-flights-to-costa-rica.aspx">cheap flights to Costa Rica</a> and travel to its neighborhood, Turrialba. It's known for its stunning vistas of Costa Rica's rural countryside, the rarely seen but worthwhile Parque Nacional Volcan Turrialba, and the prized Turrialba cheese. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Rio Pacuare in Turrialba, Costa Rica, has some of the most spectacular rafting in the country. As the river rushes down the Caribbean slope, it is flanked by virgin rainforests and magnificent canyons, a blend of fierce runs punctuated with the tranquility that allows you to catch your breath and take in some of the breathtaking green surroundings. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Montverde</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Montverde is Costa Rica's second-most popular tourist destination, and it is one of the country's most natural wonders. The Monteverde Cloud Forest is, without a doubt, the neighborhood's main attraction. Montverde is more of a rural village than an urban town, but it does have all of the amenities of a city. It is home to the Quaker community and their world-renowned cheese. Keep a look out for the red-eyed tree frog, Costa Rica's national symbol.  Selvatura Park, Curi Cancha Wildlife Refuge, La Reserva Bosque Nuboso Santa Elena, Sky Adventures Monteverde Park, and Serpentario de Monteverde are some of the places to visit in Montverde. </p>

                <h2>Airfare deals to Costa Rica and its neighborhood</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">A great deal to Costa starts from anywhere between $77 one-way - $589 round-trip from Hartford, $186 one-way - $391 round-trip from Atlanta, and $203 one-way - $440 round-trip from Boston. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Flying into San Jose (SJO) is faster and less expensive than flying into other Costa Rican airports for the majority of destinations. If you're traveling to Costa Rica expressly to visit the beaches of Guanacaste and the surrounding areas, though, you'll find it more convenient to fly into Liberia Airport, the country's other international airport (LIR). </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Book at least two weeks before departure to get a lower-than-average rate. The months of November, December, and January are regarded as the high season. However, September is the ideal month to avail of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">cheap flights</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">If you want to visit numerous cities, including the beaches in northern Costa Rica, flying into Managua, Nicaragua, and then taking the cheap bus to Liberia is a fantastic option. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">It can be a difficult task to decide whether to fly into San Jose or Liberia when visiting Monteverde's forest preserves. Since Monteverde and San Jose are almost identical distances apart, it would be more convenient to fly to a city that is closer to the rest of your Costa Rica schedule. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Bottom Line: </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">These spotless neighborhoods of Costa Rica are worth checking out on your next trip to this beautiful place. Do remember that you can get cheap fare deals by following the above steps and by also choosing a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/low-cost-flights-booking-deals.aspx">low-budget carrier</a>.</p>
