                    <p>The Delta 24-Hour <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cancellation-policy.aspx">Cancellation policy</a> states that if a user cancels a ticket within 24 hours of booking, the airline will return the entire amount. A passenger has a 24-hour window in which to request a complimentary cancellation. If passengers are unsure about the journey, this strategy gives them a second chance. A complete refund is available to all users. The amount of the refund is unaffected by the type of tickets utilized. After cancellation fees are reduced, non-refundable tickets will be refunded.</p>

            </div>
            <p>However, basic economy tickets will not be refunded. You must contact customer service before the deadline if you want a refund. After paying the cancellation fee, passengers with flex or refundable tickets can request a refund. Flex ticket holders have 24 hours to cancel their tickets before departure and the refund amount is calculated after cancellation costs are deducted.</p>
            <h2>Ways to get a refund at Delta</h2>

            <p>If a flight is delayed by Delta for more than three hours, customers will receive an eVoucher (same value as an air ticket). The validity of this voucher is one year from the date of purchase. The eVoucher can be used to rent a car, reserve a hotel, or save money on a future holiday. When a passenger is unsure about a trip, refundable tickets should be purchased to minimize the impact of the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-cancellation-policy.aspx">Delta cancellation fee</a> on the refund. Furthermore, if travelers cancel their scheduled flights during the risk-free period, they will receive a full refund (24 hours of booking). Within 20 business days, a refund will be sent to the original payment method. The airline may waive the passenger cancellation charge in exceptional circumstances. However, to avoid the cancellation fee, the traveler must produce a legal document as proof. Non-refundable tickets are refunded in the form of a redemption code that can be used on future flights. </p>
