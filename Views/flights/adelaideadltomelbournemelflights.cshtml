            <h3>When to plan your visit to Melbourne</h3>
            <p>Melbourne is most enjoyable throughout March through May and September through November. Melbourne is brimming with hot, sweaty tourists in the summer (North America's winter) months of December to February, while the winter season (June to August) offers cool weather and fewer visitors. After a long and hectic summer, Melbourne is still rather bustling during the fall months, when the city hosts several cuisine, cultural, and festival events. Additionally, since summer is the peak travel season, autumn is when costs drop dramatically, which greatly lowers the amount you need to set aside for your budget.</p>
