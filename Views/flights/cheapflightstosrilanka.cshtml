            <p class="text-justify">Travelers often want to visit new places and hence, they start searching for them. If you want to visit Sri Lanka but don't know where to start or how to get there, you've come to the perfect place. A piece of detailed information about the same will be provided here.

            <h3>Cheap tickets prices</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">Various flights cost less than $900 from the United States to Sri Lanka. The cheapest booked flight with Turkish Airlines is for $813, but you should expect to pay $938 on average. Further, you could get air fares as low as from Los Angeles $661 one-way - $811 round-trip, from San Francisco $657 one-way - $984 round-trip, and from New York $846 one-way - $839 round-trip.

            <h3>Documents</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">To enter Sri Lanka, foreign travelers must possess either a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA). Citizens of the Republic of Seychelles, the Republic of Maldives, and the Republic of Singapore do not need to apply for an ETA before visiting Sri Lanka. Most airlines will require a valid passport and a visa, both of which must have expiration dates that correspond to the length of stay in the nation. After presenting a physical ticket or an e-ticket, a boarding pass is issued at the check-in counter. </p>

            <h3>Few Tips to Remember</h3>


            <ul>
                <li>Visitors to Sri Lanka need a visa to enter the country, and while you may get one at the Colombo airport, you can save time by applying for an ETA visa online ahead of time. The visa is valid for 30 days from the date of entry into Sri Lanka, although it can be extended for up to six months. </li>

                <li>Traveler's cheques are frequently not accepted in Sri Lanka, so it's best to get your local currency after you've arrived. At Colombo's airport, there are money exchange counters and ATMs, and it's a good idea to change some money as soon as you arrive in case you need to pay for your airport parking. </li>

                <li>If you wish to spend some time in the center, schedule a connecting domestic flight from Colombo to Sigiriya Airport. Cinnamon Air, Sri Lanka's domestic airline, offers regular flights to Sigiriya, from whence you can continue your tour via different modes of transportation. </li>
            </ul>
