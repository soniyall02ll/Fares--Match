                <h2 class="text-justify">Vietnam</h2>

The country is known for its natural beauty and multitude of natural attractions, including extensive paddy fields, limestone islands in Halong Bay, and a gigantic cave system in Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park. This is one of the <b>cheapest countries to visit</b>.</p>

Consider a $1.50 soup with rice noodles, cilantro, a delicious broth, and a whole pork shank, or a $1 cup of strong, aromatic coffee. When it comes to transportation, renting a motorcycle will suffice for the day. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Kenya</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Kenya, which is located in East Africa, is home to a wide range of Flora and Fauna species. Cheap flights ticket bookings can be made for Kenya.

Safaris can be taken to see the wildlife and take in natural beauty. The Maasai Mara Reserve and Amboseli National Park are the most popular tourist destinations in Kenya because they are home to some of the best wildlife, including lions, tigers, and elephants.

                <h2 class="text-justify">Northern Thailand</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">On a tight budget, the north of Thailand is ideal.

Even in famous tourist destinations like Chiang Mai and Pai, basic rooms may be found for less than $5. Sticking to street food will not only save you money but will also provide you with a far more authentic and wonderful experience. In terms of activities, you don't need a lot of money to have a good time because most of them are inexpensive, such as seeing the White Temple, hiking, or getting together with three other people from your hostel to rent a car and go on day trips. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">India</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">India may be the cheapest country to visit, but only if you're willing to haggle and shop around. Keep in mind that traveling to India is very inexpensive as almost every airline provides cheap tickets. Also note, $3 accommodations are pretty poor, and you can get easy public transportation too. The north will be difficult to find affordable jewels, but the south, with its stunning beaches, maybe a better chance. </p>

You will find beautiful monuments in almost every part of the country. Every state has its unique food recipe so you are going to be amazed by everything during your visit to India. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Romania</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Romania is ideal for those looking for a <a href="">budget-friendly European vacation.</a>While Dracula is the country's most famous resident, most visitors are unaware of the country's many attractive towns and free activities. You may also take advantage of the free walking tours to visit the countless historical monuments, whether you're enjoying a lengthy stroll through the medieval towns or people-watching in one of the gorgeous parks. </p>

                Hostels cost $10-$15 a night, and the cuisine is filling and wonderful (a money-saving tip: eat breakfast at the hostel, have a huge hearty lunch, then cook your dinner). Getting fresh vegetables at a local market is simple and inexpensive; just make sure you have reliable transportation. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Greece</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">While travel, hotel, and tour rates have significantly decreased since the country's fiscal crisis in 2010, summer months continue to be more expensive. This means avoiding the warmest and busiest months in Greece, July, and August. Instead, visit Greece a few weeks before or after the summer season to avoid the crowds and to save money. This time, you may also avail cheap flights ticket bookings. You can also save money on food by purchasing fresh produce at the market and preparing your meals, as eating out in restaurants in some parts of Greece can be costly. A simple picnic on a beautiful beach can be just as pleasurable as a fancy supper at a seafood restaurant! Spend on visiting places in Greece instead.</p>
