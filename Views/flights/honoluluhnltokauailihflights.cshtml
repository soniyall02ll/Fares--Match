            <h2>When to Visit </h2>
            <p>Due to variations in the climate and the probability of showers, the best time to get cheap flights to Kauai from Honolulu is in the spring, from the middle of April to June, or in the fall, from early September to November. This is so because throughout these months, the weather is good, and more so, the island does not experience a lot of traffic; hence, the experience is more enjoyable. Summer is perfect for beach activities, though the rates are higher and establishments busier. The ideal season is winter because it is warmer, but it may be wetter than the other seasons since it is the tourists' high season, resulting in high charges. Autumn, or spring, is the best time for those who do not like crowds and comfortable temperatures.  </p>
