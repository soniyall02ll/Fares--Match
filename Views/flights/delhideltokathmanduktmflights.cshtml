            <h2>Best Time to Visit Kathmandu</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kathmandu is best visited in the spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) seasons. These months are very conducive for sightseeing and trekking because they have clear skies with moderate temperatures.</li>
                <li>During spring, blooming flowers give a vibrant appearance, whereas during autumn, the imposing mountains surrounding the city attract tourists due to their stunning views.</li>

                <li>On the other hand, winter (December–February) is cold, but this period can also have its advantages since it has less tourist traffic.</li>
