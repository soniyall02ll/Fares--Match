            <p class="text-justify">Mexico City is one of the most important centres of culture and finance in the world.

While the city continued to prosper through trade, which was easy due to its accessible location, the native flora and fauna, as well as the indigenous people, continued to suffer. The country finally gained its freedom from the Spanish powers. It slowly developed into a unique nation with the rich cultural heritage that we know today.
