            <p class="text-justify">It's normal to experience some doubt right before making travel arrangements. Is now the ideal moment to purchase a ticket? Must I hold off?

Spring and fall shoulder seasons are the greatest times to visit if you want to avoid the crowds.

            <p class="text-justify">Your best chance of finding cheaper deals on Dallas hotels is to travel during the winter, but check the calendar before making a reservation.
