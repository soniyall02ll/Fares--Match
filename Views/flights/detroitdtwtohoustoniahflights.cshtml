            <h3>Which airlines fly to Houston? </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>Spirit Airlines </h5></li>
                <p class="text-justify">If flying Spirit is your least expensive option, you must weigh the risk of erratic operations. Your journey will be among Spirit's many delayed and canceled flights in the US airline industry. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">In the global airline industry, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>United Airlines flights</b></a> hold a monopoly on several routes in East Asia, Australia, and, to some extent, Europe. Many travelers opt to fly it because it is occasionally less expensive than its Star Alliance counterparts, including Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and Air New Zealand. </p>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-justify">Three airports are under the management and operation of the Houston Airport System: Ellington Airport/Houston Spaceport (EFD), William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), and George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). </p>
