            <p class="text-justify">Are you visiting Dallas this weekend? Plan and book cheap flights to Dallas using Faresmatch. Dallas, with its many museums and art districts, is the new hipster hotspot, flourishing in the arts and culture sector. Dallas is a large metropolis that retains its small-town feel despite its tall skyscrapers and convoluted freeways. Local bootmakers and upscale stores coexist here, while filet mignon and handcrafted cocktails are served in saloons. The city's historical importance as the hub of the cotton and oil industries and its location along many railroad lines contributed to its notoriety. Stroll through the hip Deep Ellum and enjoy live music, or spend a day seeing museums in the largest arts district in the United States. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">There is greenery around, though the buildings themselves bring people here (see out the Reunion Tower for a 360-degree panorama of the skyline). Take a stroll along the Katy Trail or visit the Dallas Arboretum to witness the blooming cherry trees in the spring. Yes, Tex-Mex and BBQ are popular here and well worth checking out, but Dallas's vibrant East African culture also produces some of the best Ethiopian food. Take a gourmet trip through the city's colourful and daring food culture for a memorable experience. Try one of Dallas' many culinary challenges, such as the enormous 7-pound burger at Kenny's Burger Joint in Plano in sixty minutes or the 20-scoop ice cream mountain, the Mount Hypnotic, at Hypnotic Emporium on Garland Road, to liven things up a little.
