            <h2>The best time to schedule a trip to Paris from Newark</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">September through October and June through August are the ideal times to visit Paris. There are ups and downs in both summer and fall. Paris experiences almost ideal weather from June to August. There are several days of sunshine with average highs in the upper 70s. Regretfully, summer is also the most expensive and busiest season. Go in the fall for much-reduced queues at attractions and lower travel costs. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Although the city's spring blooms are also rather well-known, the seasonal greenery is known to dazzle. If you're only looking for a deal on travel, going there in the winter will save you a lot of money. Remember, though, that Paris welcomes over 30 million tourists yearly, making it one of the world's most visited cities. Thus, there will be visitors and some crowds when you visit. </p>
