            <h2>When to Visit Chicago? </h2>
            <p> The preferred time to book<a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/chicago-ord-to-new-orleans-msy-flights.aspx"><b>flights from Chicago to New Orleans</b></a> is autumn or early spring because of the mild climate and favorable festivities such as the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Try to avoid the hot summer period you find in this region as much as possible. The best time to visit Chicago is during late spring, May and June, and early autumn, September, and October because, during those periods, the weather is moderate, making it suitable for seasons of attractions like the Millennium Park and the Navy Pier of the State. </p>
            <p> These seasons also are relatively less popular with tourists than during the high summer travel season. The cultural events in both cities happen all year round, but the best time for a visit is during these climate windows, so lots of outdoor activities and landmark visits can take place comfortably. </p>
