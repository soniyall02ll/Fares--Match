            <p>
                To ensure you get the best deal possible on your Southwest flight, make your way straight to the Southwest Low Fare Calendar. This easy-to-use Calendar will let you search month by month, quickly giving you a list of dates when the fares are the cheapest. It will help if you look for the Low Fare Calendar option on Southwest's homepage.
                <br>
                Rather than searching for the exact dates, you can use the Low Fare Calendar to find the cheapest dates to fly within a month. For this, tap in the month you're looking to make your trip to start the low-fare search process. From here, Southwest will display the list of the lowest airfare prices available on each date. Choosing a day earlier or later or going on vacation the following week instead can deduct your airfare costs in half in many cases. One thing to keep in mind is that you need to select your departure & return flight separately. Once you are done selecting both departure & return dates, you will notice the flight time options. You can still toggle between adjacent dates on this page. You can also filter your flight by departure time, several stops, and time of day.
                It is important to note that not all fares that are the low price will be listed on the Low Fare Calendar. The cheapest fares will almost always be endless options. However, if that date and time work for you, you will be the luckiest. Like any airline, being flexible with your travel dates and destination can save you hundreds of dollars when flying Southwest Airlines.
