Your destination must depend on what you want from the trip. Your personality also depends on whether you are comfortable outside your comfort zone. </p>

Book the hotels in advance so that you might face trouble after reaching. Therefore getting everything planned is mandatory before any solo trip. </p>


                <h2 class="text-justify">Pack light</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">While planning your solo trip, always keep in mind to pack light. You never know the distance in a country can be so vast. Sometimes if your luck is not by your side, you might not find intermediate transport either. Therefore, packing your luggage according to your carrying capacity is the best option. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Carry only those things which are necessary. For example, if the hotel you will stay in provides toiletries and bathing towels, cut them off your packing list. You must include a first aid box, power bank, money belt and a few resaleable plastic bags in your packing list on your solo trip. Therefore try to pack light yet brilliant. </p>

Book your tickets so that you don't reach your destination either very late in the night or early in the morning. Check-in time should also be considered.
