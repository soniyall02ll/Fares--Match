                <h2>Checked Baggage Allowance</h2>
                <p>If you don’t know, this airline is known for its generous checked baggage allowance, which depends on the route and travel class.</p>
                <h3>Weight Limits</h3>
                <p>Economy Class: 20–35 kg (44–77 lbs), depending on the fare type.</p>
                <p>Business Class: 40 kg (88 lbs).</p>

                <h3>Infant Baggage Allowance</h3>
                <p>For passengers who are traveling with infants, Emirates provides additional allowances:</p>
                <p>One extra checked bag (up to 10 kg or 23 kg, depending on route).</p>
                <p>A collapsible stroller or carrycot may also be checked free of charge.</p>
                <h2>Special Items and Sports Equipment</h2>
                <p>The airline allows passengers to check sports equipment, special items, and musical instruments within the baggage allowance. However, some items, such as bulky items and bicycles, require pre-approval by the airline.</p>
                <h2>What About Excess Baggage</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, if your baggage exceeds the free allowance, then additional charges are applicable, and they are based on the passengers' route.</p>
                <h2>What are the tips for Hassle-Free Travel?</h2>
                <p>You must weigh your bags before leaving for the airport. Many passengers don’t weigh and check the dimensions of their bags, and as a result, they need to pay the extra baggage fee. You can use the portable luggage scale to avoid expensive surprises at the airport.</p>
                <p>Also, make sure to check the airline's route-specific guidelines and policies. They can affect your route, and you must double-check while booking the tickets.</p>
                <p>You can also pre-purchase extra luggage, which helps you save money at the airport. Purchasing an additional baggage allowance online is better than making a last-minute payment at the airport.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Hence, this is all about the airline's baggage policies, designed to offer flexibility and convenience that ensure passengers' ease by understanding the airline policy's size and weight limits.  This top-rated airline provides the best services to passengers right now. From premium economy to business class, every fare and cabin class experience is top-notch for this airline.
