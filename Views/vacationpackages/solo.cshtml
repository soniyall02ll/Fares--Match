            <h2>Safety Precautions for Independent Travellers</h2>
            <p>Independent travel is very rewarding, but safety is paramount.  Never wear valuables, and always have your travel papers secure. Get travel insurance to be on the safe side and stay in lodging that has excellent reviews. Get connected with friends or family members by sharing your itinerary.</p>
            <p>FaresMatch provides you with easy access to quality single vacation packages with reputable partners so you are in capable hands when travelling. Group tours or guided day tours are an equally good idea—they provide security and chances to socialize.</p>

            <h2>How to Save Solo Travelling?</h2>
            <p>Solo travelling doesn’t equate to having to double the bill. With effective planning, one can save and enjoy much from their experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for holiday packages including airfare so as to minimise booking prices for individual travel.</li>
                <li>Booking <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/vacation-packages.aspx"><b>vacation packages</b></a> also economises because they bundle meals, accommodation, and activities—most times less expensive than booking them separately. </li>
                <li>Choose hostels with single rooms, low-budget hotels, or shared group accommodations. Eat like the locals at street markets or tiny restaurants instead of tourist restaurants. </li>
                <li>Finally, be flexible with your travel dates and destinations—occasionally, a bit of spontaneity reaps the greatest rewards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Travelling alone is liberating, educational, and surprisingly affordable. With proper planning and tools, such as FaresMatch, travelling the world solo becomes an option and an adventure. Select from a range of single-traveller packages that fit your sense of adventure and budget, and enjoy the independence that comes with travelling on your own schedule.</p>
