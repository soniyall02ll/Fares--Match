            <p class="text-justify">Italy is a European country with 20 distinct regions, each with its rich history, culture, and traditions. It was here that the Renaissance began and where Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Marco Polo, and Christopher Columbus were born. The great food that you may enjoy here is the cherry on top. The most frequent flights from the United States to Italy are operated by ITA Airways, Delta, and Air France. The most popular route is from New York to Rome, which is served by Delta, ITA Airways, and Air France. Although US citizens do not require a visa to enter Italy, the country is a part of the Schengen Zone, thus permanent residents and other foreign nationals wishing to fly from the US to Italy should check to see if they need to apply for permission to enter. A nonstop trip takes around 11 hours and 23 minutes and covers a distance of 4779 miles. New York - Rome is the most common route, with an average travel time of 8h 05m. </p>

            <h2>Airlines that fly directly from the United States to Italy</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">Direct flights from the United States to major Italian cities such as Naples, Milan, Rome, and Venice are available from several airlines. Travelers can fly direct from Miami International Airport to Rome in 12 hours, and 5 minutes. TAP Air Portugal, Vueling Airlines, and Iberia all provide direct flights from Boston to Rome. Only Lufthansa and United Airlines offer direct flights to Naples from New York's JFK International Airport.

            <h3>Do you get any options for a stopover between the US and Italy?</h3>

            <p class="text-justify">When flying to Milan from JFK Airport, you can save money by booking a ticket that includes at least one stop. Common stops include London Gatwick Airport, Dubai Airport, and Paris Airport. On the quickest routes, these aircraft can arrive in Milan in roughly 9h 40m. Stopover flights at JFK International Airport, Boston Logan International Airport, and other airports can also be used to get to Rome. The Logan Airport route includes stops at Barcelona Airport, Madrid Airport, and Istanbul Airport. The duration of the flights varies, but they usually last roughly 15 hours and 30 minutes. </p>

            <h4>Prices of Cheap Flight tickets :</h4>

            <p class="text-justify">The cheapest one-way ticket to Italy from the United States is $27, and the cheapest round-trip ticket is $405.

            <h5>Major Information to learn before flying</h5>

            <p class="text-justify">The two international airports in Rome that receive flights from the United States are Fiumicino Airport (FLE) and Ciampino Airport (CIA). Milan (Malpensa Airport- MXP) is the principal port of call for exploring the northwestern cities of Genoa and Turin, while Venice Marco Polo Airport (VCE) covers the northeastern provinces of Trieste and Bologna. The island of Elba is located off the western coast of Italy and is accessible from Florence Peretola Airport (FLR) in Tuscany. If you want to travel further south to the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, fly from the United States to Rome or Naples and then take local flights. From Trieste in the north to Venice in the center, Rimini and Ancona in the middle region, and Bari and Lecce in the south, the Italian coastline that borders the Adriatic Sea has proven tourist destinations, despite being off the main path. The cities and towns along this corridor can be reached by flying to Venice, Rome, or Naples. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Last note: </h2>

            <p class="text-justify">Finally, keep note that the main tourism season runs from late June to August, and because of the warm and pleasant weather, this is the perfect time to fly to Italy. In terms of tourism, April to mid-June is the shoulder season. You can easily find <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-italy.aspx">cheap flights to Italy</a> at this time as there are fewer people than during the high season, and airline tickets and hotel rates are less expensive.</p>
