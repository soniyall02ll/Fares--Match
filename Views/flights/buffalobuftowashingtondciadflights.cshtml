            <h2>Best Time to Book Flight Tickets</h2>
            <p>Time is important when looking for cheap flights, mainly because it determines the amount of money that one can spend on a fare.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generally, airlines keep their fares low in their off-peak periods, and therefore <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>booking flights</b></a> early or travelling in the low season, that is, during spring or fall, will help you get the cheapest fares. </li>
                <li>Flights that are scheduled in the early morning and those that are offered in the middle of the week are cheap as well. </li>
                <li>When it comes to the fares and charges, an option to check on the flexible dates on the websites, such as FaresMatch, can minimise your fares.</li>
            </ul>
