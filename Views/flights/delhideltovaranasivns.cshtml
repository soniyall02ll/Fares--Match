            <p>India's spiritual capital is Varanasi, referred to as Banaras or Kashi (City of Life), the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. It is one of the seven sacred towns in Hinduism. Scattered in a maze of tiny galis, the ancient city of Varanasi is located along the western banks of the Ganges. Varanasi is surrounded by temples at nearly every corner, but the most well-known and oldest of them is the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.</p>

            <p>Benaras is appropriately called the city of Lord Shiva for a reason.
