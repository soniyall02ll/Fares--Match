                            <p class="text-justify"><b>LGBT-friendly countries</b>, people, places, and policies create an environment that is open and welcoming to the LGBT community. An environment that is supportive of the gay community and their relationships, deals with all people equally, and is non-judgmental. Trans-friendly vacation spots are widening. Whether you're looking for a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/romantic-weekend-getaways-for-couples-in-usa.aspx">romantic getaway</a>, a trip with friends, or even a dream <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/5-best-honeymoon-destinations-in-the-united-states.aspx">honeymoon destination</a>, the options are now better than ever! </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Pride festivals have returned with a vengeance, bringing joy and celebration to the many dimensions of LGBTIQ+ love and existence. To assist you in deciding where to travel on your next LGBT vacation, FaresMatch has compiled a list of LGBT-friendly places. These are the world's most advanced, broad, and accepting destinations where you can truly express your pride. </p>

                            <h2>Sydney, Australia</h2>

                            <p class="text-justify">Sydney's Gay Mardi Gras is one of the world's biggest LGBTIQ+ festivals, taking place each year in February or March. The year 2023 will be a watershed moment for the city, as it will host World Pride, a bi-annual event that rotates between cities and attracts guests from all over the world. The Darlinghurst neighborhood, which is strategically placed in Sydney's central business district and is easily accessible by the city's public transit system, is the gay Sydney's beating heart. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Even though the homosexual marriage was only recognized in Australia in 2017, the country has long been a tolerant haven for the LGBTQ community. Sydney is Australasia's and the South Pacific's LGBTIQ+ epicenter, with a global reputation for inclusivity. The city not only offers fantastic LGBTIQ+ nightlife, but it also has a passionately queer culture that embraces LGBTIQ. Since the 1980s, the Darlinghurst Bookshop has sold LGBT books, publications, and films, and the city hosts the annual Queer Screen film festival. </p>

                            <h3>Ibiza, Spain</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">Everyone knows about the <b>gay-friendly islands</b> of Ibiza as a party hotspot, but the small island is also recognized for its beaches, each with its special beauty. The town beach, Figueretes, is ideal for sunbathers who prefer a quiet atmosphere and tranquil water. Es Cavallet, on the island's southern tip, is the principal homosexual beach. Cala Conta offers breath-taking sunset views. Ses Salinas is known for its eclectic mix and fantastic beach bars, while Port Des Torrent is ideal for homosexual couples. </p>

                            <h3>San Francisco</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">San Francisco is one of the most progressive cities in the United States, with a long history of homosexual rights activism, and is sometimes referred to as the gay capital of the United States, making it a fantastic <b>LGBT-friendly beach holiday</b>. In this northern Californian city, LGBT visitors will undoubtedly receive a warm welcome. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">One thing is sure, LGBT visitors to San Francisco will not be bored. With cultural activities and entertainment mainly targeted at an LGBT audience. We recommend going to the Castro District, which is near the city's center and has more sing-along nights and queer-led cinema than you can shake a designer shoe at! Alternatively, simply unwind and enjoy the tranquil beauty of the Bay Area. In June, San Francisco hosts its Pride Celebration &amp; Parade, which is one of the largest Pride events in the world. </p>

                            <h3>Toronto</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">Canada has some of the world's most progressive LGBT policies, and you can see a modern, inclusive attitude across the country. This includes Toronto, the country's largest metropolis. Toronto has a vibrant LGBT community centered in the Church and Wellesley neighborhood in the city's south end. However, similar to Sydney, you can expect a warm welcome across the city, with plenty of LGBT-friendly stores, bars, and enterprises to make you feel good. </p>

                            <h3>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">
                                Fort Lauderdale, also known as the "Venice of America," is where the boys hang out. Sebastian Street Gay Beach, which is close to most gay resorts, is one of the<b> most popular gay beach destinations</b>. Along with the dozens of LGBT-friendly shops along the beach, the city also has a thriving gay bar and restaurant scene, including Hamburger Mary's, which is a terrific place to start or end the night.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Puerto Vallarta, Mexico</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">Puerto Vallarta Pride is one of Mexico's largest Pride events, attracting a diverse crowd of locals and foreigners. Emiliano Zapata is the epicentre of Puerto Vallarta's LGBT nightlife. The city, on the other hand, is an LGBTIQ+ vacation hotspot, and it's nearly hard to locate a neighborhood that isn't accommodating. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Mexico has become increasingly LGBTIQ-friendly over the years, and Puerto Vallarta, an oceanfront resort town, is one of the country's most progressive cities. All of the major resort brands are LGBTIQ-friendly, and there are even LGBTIQ-only hotels, such as the Almar Resort. There are several opportunities to socialize and meet other members of the community. There's no shortage of places to visit, from the beach, and indoor/outdoor Mr. Flamingo to the comic-book-inspired Blondies Loft and Slush Bar and even the sleek and modern La Noche. There are also amazing beaches, including Playa de Los Muertos, which is known as PV's "gay beach." </p>

                            <h3>Puerto Rico</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">Puerto Rico is unquestionably a pioneer in <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/queer-friendly-destinations-by-faresmatch.aspx">gay-friendly travel destinations</a> in the Caribbean when it comes to accepting LGBT+ culture. San Juan, the island's capital, celebrates annual pride parades and seamlessly integrates history and the present. El Cojo, Tia Maria Liquor Store, The Bear Tavern, and Circo, the city's largest gay club, are all located here. </p>

                            <h3>St. Barts</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">St. Barts is a wealthy island, as seen by its magnificent villas, <b>LGBT-friendly resort Caribbean</b>, and yachts. Be sure that the locals will not be pushed, anxious, or concerned about who you take to bed, as is typical of the French. Although there isn't a defined gay scene as in Chelsea or <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-san-francisco.aspx">San Francisco</a>, you'll be able to live your best gay life in almost any pub or club. The beach in Saline is said to be ideal for cruising, particularly for gay males. </p>

                            <h3>Brighton, United Kingdom</h3>

                            <p class="text-justify">There is no more gorgeous place in the UK that is more gay-friendly. Brighton is a lovely city. From the burnt-out old pier to The Lanes, everything is exactly right. There are hundreds of bars, restaurants, and lodging options to select from, so there will never be a shortage of things to do, a decent meal, or a place to stay. </p>
