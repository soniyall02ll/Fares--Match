                        <h2>Ancient Legends and Modern Life Collide</h2>
                        <p>Visit the Parthenon, and the lively Plaka. One can visit these places in the day and enjoy rooftop dinners by night with the panoramic view of the city. Also, the Acropolis is a must-visit. Included in the museums, markets, tavernas, and many varied cultural immersion activities are night tours through the cities that many package handiwork engraves in their programmes.</p>
                        <p>Athens is that place, whether the visitor is new or a history buff, that engages in its portentous on-the-road-to beginning with Greek tales.</p>

            <h2>Explore Greece’s Most Romantic and Photogenic Escape</h2>
            <p>The Church of St Nicholas on the Cliffside and the famous Santorini sunsets make the island one of the most photographed islands from different parts of the world. Most vacations would include a relaxing sojourn on these shores where one can just have fun at volcanic beaches or seek magnificently fine dining. The island's beauty is nothing short of spellbinding and would certainly serve for all-inclusive trips for couples and honeymooners considering their options for travel to Greece.</p>
            <p>Scenic sailing features, wonderful tours and small local artisanal shops will ensure magnificent moments at each twist and turn of Santorini. Such a heavenly serenade only makes it one of the most solicited stops in all Greece trip packages.</p>

            <h2>Discover Crete's Historical and Natural Treasures</h2>
            <p>Crete is the largest island here. The island has historical significance and local charm and is a must-stop on most Greece vacation packages. Enjoy all manners of island activities – from visiting Knossos Palace to hiking the Samaria Gorge to sunbathing on pink Elafonissi sand.</p>
            <p>For a much more rewarding experience, one should venture outside of the resort areas. Many <b>Greece trip packages</b> offer several days in Crete, allowing the adventurer to enjoy local excursions while indulging in all the culinary delights of the region back at the resort.</p>

            <h2>Island of the Ionian Sea</h2>
            <p>While Cycladic islands keep their jealous competitors in the shade, lonesome green hills clamber down to the blue waters with a note of tranquillity; Corfu, Zakynthos, and Kefalonia are a budding star in the vacation industry, combining authenticity with jaw-dropping beauty. Venetian-style architecture, quiet beaches, and resorts for families are the trademarks of these islands.</p>
            <p>Hidden gems that the travel site includes in various <b>Greece vacation packages</b> provide for a less-travelled and equally rewarding escape. The Ionian region is fantastic for nature lovers and those interested in culture, providing a welcome contrast to Greece's traditional island-hopping itinerary.</p>

            <h2>What Does a Greece Tour Package Include?</h2>
            <p>In most cases, Greece tour packages include round-trip airfare, accommodations – from boutique hotels to beach resorts, breakfast every day, and guided tours on select days. Optional excursions could consist of wine tastings, visiting archaeological sites, or cruises with island hopping. For convenience, many of these <b>all-inclusive Greece vacations</b> also include airport transfers, inter-island ferries, and meals or drinks.</p>
            <p>By booking with FaresMatch, you will be able to get the best deals according to your preferences and travel style – whether travelling with family, on a honeymoon vacation, or alone – these all-inclusive packages let you worry less and make the most of your Greek adventure.</p>

            <p>Greece has a wonderful, ageless culture, rich history, and experience collection. With the perfect travel package, your escape will be exciting and effortless to explore all of these. Let FaresMatch help you get there.</p>
