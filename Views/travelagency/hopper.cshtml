            <p class="text-justify">For years, travelers have only booked their airplane tickets and hotels online. This is a very tiresome job and sometimes becomes quite an embassy, with different websites showing different prices for the same services. Hopper removes all this mess with a simple app. Being an online travel service provider, Hopper helps travelers book their favorite <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">cheap flights and hotels</a> at reasonable prices. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Their main attraction is that they have an app that helps users book their favorite services from the palm of their hands. With over 50 million downloads worldwide, Hopper has quickly become one of the best, if not the best online travel service booking website. If you plan to go on a vacation or a trip with the family, download Hopper now and enjoy. </p>

            <h2>Features that make Hopper special</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Like other travel service websites, Hopper has all the different services available for users, so people might wonder why Hopper is so special. The main reason is that Hopper is an app-based service; users no longer need to surf the web looking for the website or even a computer to do so. They can simply open the app on their phones and enjoy all the features of Hopper: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Being a relatively newer service, Hopper uses advanced data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to search hundreds of websites and offer users the best flight deals and prices for other desired services. </li>
                <li>They also have a tool that helps users predict flight prices on a given date or find out the trends of prices for that given flight. </li>
                <li>Hopper is also quite flexible as it lets the users book flights and hotels together in packages, thus reducing the costs of either of the services. </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Convenient User Interface</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Hopper's app has been developed, considering the user's convenience first. Hence it has a very easy-to-use interface with streamlined content. The different offers and services are arranged on the screen for users to see and interact with. Also, their whole theme revolves around a bunny or rabbit, and their services are also named, keeping in mind that theme. This adds to their streamlined feature and attracts customers even more. </p>


            <h3>Hopper's price alerts won't let you miss a deal</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">This platform allows users to set up price alerts, which notify them when prices for a particular flight route drop, allowing them to book their flights at the best possible prices. Although this feature is available on almost all other websites, Hopper’s price alerts are the best since it uses machine learning algorithms to predict the exact timings and amounts of the flight price drops. This enables the users to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/farecompare.aspx">compare fares</a> and decide which service they will buy. </p>


            <h3>Plethora of different services</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Unlike most other websites, Hopper is not a flight booking agency. Apart from flights, Hopper has a lot to offer its customers: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Car Rentals</b>
                    Hopper provides its users with a variety of different car rental options and a lot of different classes of cars. Users can choose the type of car they want according to their preferences and select the one that suits their budget.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Hotels</b>
                    Users can choose from various hotels, from apartments to mansions and villas. Hopper has something for everyone. Also, there are a lot of different filters that the users can choose to find out the hotels according to their preferences.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Carrot Cash</b>
                    Carrot Cash is Hopper’s reward program. Users can get their hands on points whenever they book through Hopper. The more they book, the more points they get; later, they can exchange these points for exciting offers and discounts.
                </li>
            </ul>
