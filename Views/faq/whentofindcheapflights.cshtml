            <p>Many people in this world are looking for the cheapest flight because they want to save on airfare. The best time varies depending on various factors, including destination, time of booking, and many more. Therefore, make sure to plan your trip at the best time because you can manage your ticket with the most affordable airfare. As per the recent travel trends and hacks, around 60% of Americans don't know about ways to reduce their total spending on air travel. Hence, if you want to fall under the category of 40%, then you must know the things for "when to book cheap flights". We are talking about the days, dates, and months here. We know this may be different from destination to destination. However, you need to apply the right strategy to score the best deals on airline tickets.</p>
            <h2>The best time to buy airline tickets</h2>
            <p>People who are looking to grab the best deals on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>airfare tickets</b></a> need to understand the fact there are different factors and changes in pricing. Too far booking is also not good, and you can book the tickets around 3 to 4 months before the departure date. More than five months booking is not a great idea to know about the lowest prices because sometimes last minute airfares are cheapest. You can also use the airfare tools to find flight booking deals such as Faresmatch flights, and you can learn the best prices for airline tickets as per the trends.</p>
            <h3>Truth about the domestic flights</h3>
            <p>Well, there is no need to book domestic flights too far in advance because it may also not be a good idea. Hence, you can book the domestic flight ticket around 28 days before the departure date, and you can save at least 25% more on reservations compared to last-minute flight bookings. You can choose Faresmatch because we recommend the best price on our travel search engine around 3 to 4 months before the flight ticket booking.</p>
            <h3>Truth about the international flights</h3>
            <p>On the other hand, you must book international flights at least 60 days before the departure date, but you can find the best availability and savings for the flight's reservations. Monitoring airfare prices at least 5 to 6 months before the booking is crucial.</p>
            <h2>Know about the cheapest airline for the booking</h2>
            <p>You must find the cheapest airline to book the tickets because the best time to buy the cheap tickets also refers to the information of the best airline. There are many low-cost carriers that you can choose to fly, such as Frontier and Spirit, to book cheap tickets.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Timing is critical to finding cheap flights. The best time to book flights depends on the destination's off-season. For example, May is the cheapest month to book flights to Mexico, while August is the most affordable time to fly there. Additionally, the cheapest time of day to book is early morning (between 3 AM and 5 AM) or late at night. Understanding your destination's peak and off-seasons will help you secure the best deals.</p>
