                            <p class="text-justify">Frontier Airlines is the first choice of so many Americas who just want to travel with this airline. As we know, there are so many benefits of choosing Frontier Airlines Fare Classes and the benefits are not limited up to one or two class and every class of Frontier has some benefits. First of all, with the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/frontier-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Frontier Airlines Reservations </b></a>you will get the facility of booking with the different fare classes. The basic fare classes of this airline are F, J, and Y. </p>
                            <h2>Explanation on J, F and Y Class of Frontier: </h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Well, the J, F and Y Class of Frontier Class are different from each other. If you are thinking that all are the same then you are wrong. Take a look: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Meaning of J Class of Frontier: Business Class</li>
                                <li>Meaning of F Class of Frontier: First Class</li>
                                <li>Meaning of Y Class of Frontier: Economy Class</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="text-justify">Therefore, I hope you understand the basic meaning of all three classes of Frontier airlines. The fares of these classes are also different from each other. Each Fare Class has its benefits and features (which most of the people don’t know while the booking of Frontier Flights).   Now, the Frontier has broken up their fare class into four different classes including Classic Plus, Classic, Economy and Basic. On the <b>Frontier Airlines Official Site</b>, you can also check about the chart of each type of fare class of this airline and benefits as well. </p>
