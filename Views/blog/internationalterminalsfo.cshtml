            <p>One of the largest North American international terminals is San Francisco International Airport's Dianne Feinstein.<b>International terminal SFO</b> is known for its high-tech architecture and sheer scale, and also has a passenger-centric design that makes travel easier. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill has designed the terminal; the five-level, 1.8 million-square-foot steel terminal opened in 2000. There are two boarding areas of this terminal, including A (Gates A1–A15) and G (Gates G1–G14), for 29 gates. Most of the gates can handle double-deck aircraft like the A380. </p>
            <H2>Structure and Layout</H2>
