            <h2>How Flight Costs Change According to Day?</h2>
            <p>Before we discuss the best times to travel and book, we need to know why flight prices change during the week. Airlines depend on sophisticated pricing strategies that respond to how many tickets are being sold, past trends, the level of competition and what has happened before. Let’s look at a few explanations for why some days have cheaper tickets.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The prices of flights tend to be higher on Mondays and Fridays due to more business travellers. On the contrary, most leisure travellers book trips for Friday or Sunday, since these are traditional days for starting the weekend.</li>
                <li>Since a lot of people go on weekends, both journey and flight prices are higher on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.</li>
                <li>Load management is important so airlines will sometimes offer cheaper tickets when passengers are fewer. For this reason, specific dates have better discounts than others. We’ll explore the days when you’re most likely to save money.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Weekday flight tickets: least expensive</h2>
            <p>If you want to save money, most people say that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the <b>best day to book flights</b>.</p>
            <h3>Tuesdays and Wednesdays Better for Your Wallet</h3>
            <p>Traveling on these days is not popular with regular travellers. To help fill empty planes, many airlines are giving out <b>discount flights</b> for bookings. Based on several travel studies (FaresMatch and Google Flights), booking a flight on Tuesdays or Wednesdays means savings of up to 15-20% when compared to weekend flights.</p>
            <h3>Midweek Is a Smart Choice</h3>
            <p>Smaller crowds at the airport mean you move through quicker during security and boarding. You’ll probably find better seats for your travel companions or the spots you prefer. Low-crowd flights may let you upgrade for less money. Going from Delhi to Dubai on Friday and flying back on Sunday may cost around ₹28,000. Booking your ticket on a Tuesday or Thursday could bring down the price to as little as ₹21,000, depending when you’re traveling.</p>
            <h3>If you want to avoid break-the-bank travel, stay away from these two days.</h3>
            <p>While some days are more affordable than others, there are times that are much more costly for budget travellers. Traveling away from these busy days can let you purchase tickets for much less money. It is best to avoid Fridays and Sundays. For many reasons, Fridays and Sundays often have the highest ticket prices.</p>

            <h2>Best tips to identify cheapest day to fly</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You should try to travel on Sunday night or Friday afternoon when many colleagues are flying.</li>
                <li>Competition among passengers for airline seats is high-airlines expect people to spend more for convenience.</li>
                <li>Apart from weekly patterns, airfares skyrocket around significant festivals or holidays, particularly if they coincide with weekends. High costs are a hallmark of holidays like Diwali, Christmas, Eid, and New Year's Eve, especially if your travel dates fall on long weekends.</li>
            </ul>
