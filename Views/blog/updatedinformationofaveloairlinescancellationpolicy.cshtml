            <p class="text-justify">Avelo is a customer-oriented airline based in the United States that operates on a regular schedule. Although the airline's headquarters are in Houston, the Hollywood Burbank Airport serves as its hub. The airline mostly serves the United States' West Coast and East Coast. Andrew Levy, a former executive at both Allegiant Travel and United Airlines, founded the airline in 2021. It is a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/low-cost-flights-booking-deals.aspx">low-cost airline</a> that flies throughout the United States regularly. The airline caters to domestic and international visitors in the United States by providing the most competitive prices and the best level of reliability. They focus on domestic routes that aren't served by many — if any — other airlines. Avelo offers point-to-point flights to cities in the United States that are currently underserved. The airline uses Boeing 737-800 aircraft with a seating capacity of 189 passengers in a single cabin configuration. Their booking process is simple and so is canceling a flight. Let's check out a complete guide on their Cancellation and refund policy.</p>

            <h2>An overview of the Cancellation Policy</h2>

There may be an emergency, or you may be planning to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances or complications on the day of the flight. According to Avelo Airlines' cancellation policy, passengers can cancel their tickets for free within 24 hours after purchasing them. However, at least one week before the departure date, reservations must be made. It provides several online and offline solutions for canceling flights. Passengers must cancel in the same manner as they book them to make the process simple. If the travelers cancel their tickets within 24 hours of purchase, an Avelo refund will be sent immediately. Passengers, however, will be charged cancellation fees if the flight is delayed. If the passengers include a third party in the booking process, they must cancel directly through that channel. They would be unable to make any modifications via the internet. It is important to remember that the refund will only be issued if the passengers purchased a refundable ticket. The airline is not responsible for any refunds if non-refundable tickets are purchased. </p>
