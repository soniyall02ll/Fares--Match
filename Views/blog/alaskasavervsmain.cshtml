                <p class="text-justify">Saver Fare is always in demand because of lowest airfare benefits of the Alaska Airlines. Are you thinking to choose this option of airline? If yes, then you must know the difference between <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/alaska-airlines-saver-fare-review.aspx">Alaska Saver Vs Main</a>.  What is the main difference between these two fare classes? </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">1). Lowest Prices & Higher Prices: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">With the booking of Alaska Airlines Saver Tickets, a passenger can browse for the lowest prices and the lowest price tickets. Thus, if you want to get the lowest prices for the tickets booking, then consider the reservations of Alaska Airlines Saver Fare but if you don’t have any issue to pay little bit higher price then book the tickets with the main cabin of the airline. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">2). Seat Selection: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">You will not get the feature of seat selection, when you book the tickets of Alaska Airlines Saver Fare but when you choose the main cabin of the airline, and then this feature came in the fare of main cabin as well. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">3). Earn Miles Every Time When You Fly: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">You can earn miles every time when you fly by choosing the Alaska Airlines Saver and Main Cabin tickets both. Yes, that’s the right thing and if you are thinking that you can’t earn the miles in the saver fare of Alaska Air then you are wrong. </p>
