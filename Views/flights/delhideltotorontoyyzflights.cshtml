            <h2>How to Explore Toronto</h2>
            <p>To explore Toronto the best way you must plan and to help you out Faresmatch provides you with a short tour plan of Toronto. While booking <b>flight tickets from Delhi to Toronto</b> have a look at the tour plan.</p>


            <p><b>Day 1</b></p>
            <p>Start your day with a brunch at Dundas. Take a picture with the iconic Toronto sign and visit City Hall as you explore Nathan Phillips Square. Make sure to stop by the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO). After you've satisfied your appetite for art or shopping, go to Chinatown for lunch. Next head to Steamwhistle Brewery, the CN Tower, and Ripley's Aquarium, by taking the 510 streetcar to the Harbourfront.</p>


            <p><b>Day 2</b></p>
            <p>Visit Flo's Diner for brunch or Yorkville for coffee and pastries. After spending some time exploring the historic structures, such as Hart House, I returned to Bloor to visit either the ceramics-focused Gardiner Museum or the natural history-focused Royal Ontario Museum (ROM). Continue southward via Little Italy and stop at Trinity Bellwoods Park. Spend the evening with a leisurely ride on Lake Ontario to see the cityscape from a new perspective.</p>


            <p><b>Day 3</b></p>
            <p>Take a trip to Niagara Falls on your last day; it's only a few hours' drive from downtown Toronto. Boarding The Hornblower to the bottom of the falls is a fun experience for kids. Choose between an exciting sport, such as jet boating or ziplining in the gorge, or a leisurely one, such as a horse-and-carriage ride around Niagara-on-the-Lake's ancient streets.</p>

            <h2>When to Visit Toronto From Delhi</h2>

This time of year is perfect for touring and outdoor activities because it avoids the extremes of summer throng and winter cold.
