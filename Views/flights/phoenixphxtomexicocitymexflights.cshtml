            <h2>Visit the Beauty Mexico City Has to Offer—Cultural Jewel</h2>
            <p>This is beautiful, and Mexico City has a lot more to offer, blending old tradition with innovations, and still here are some more reasons why you should be putting this on your travel list.</p>
            <p><b>Explore Historical Destinations</b></p>
            <p>You can start your trip at the Zocalo, the plaza surrounded by this amazing colonial architecture.

            <p><b>Experience the Taste of Mexico</b></p>
            <p>The gastronomical experience of Mexico City, in the broadest perspective, is an adventure—a culinary roller coaster ride from street taco-inspired bona fide street eats to gourmet high-end dining. Do try to sample some local flavours: churros, pozole, and mole poblano.</p>
            <p><b>Enjoy Bright Nightlife</b></p>
            <p>Night falls, and Mexico City explodes with its lively nightlife. Trendy bars and clubs can be found in Roma Norte, while the Zona Rosa is considered the city of dancing at night. Live music venues, featuring mariachi bands or contemporary acts, complete the city’s action.</p>

            <p><b>Xochimilco—Floating Gardens</b></p>
            <p>In the time of Xochimilco, the city is awash in its sweet chaos. This would be famous for its colourful boats called trajineras, and one would expect to float down its canals while live music and tasty bites are enjoyed in the tender aquatic caress of Mexico’s prize site.</p>
            <p><b>Coyoacan—A Bohemian Paradise</b></p>
            <p>Once in a while, a nice little corner of Mexico City becomes Caloocan. It is for the lovers of all things art and history. Walk along its cobblestoned lanes and take part in artisan markets; drop by the houses of famous artists such as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.</p>
