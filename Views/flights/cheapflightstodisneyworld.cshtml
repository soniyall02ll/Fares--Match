            <ul>
                <li>The <b>airfare to Disney World</b>, or rather the cost of flying there, tends to differ drastically according to the season and the place of origin. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>If you want to enjoy the magical world thanks to fewer people around and relatively cheaper air tickets to Disney World, then travel during the low season from the middle of January to early March, or after the summer peak in September. </li>
                <li>The Christmas period (from the end of November to the end of December) is delightful because of the festive decorations up, but there are also huge crowds and expensive prices. </li>
                <li>The spring season (mid-April through May) and the autumn season (October) have pleasant weather conditions, an average number of visitors, and most of the time low fares on aeroplane tickets and lodging facilities. </li>
