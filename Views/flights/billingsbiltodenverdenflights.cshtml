            <h2>Best time to Visit Denver</h2>
            <p>Since it's the beginning of fall and you might see the leaves turning orange and crimson, mid-September to mid-October are regarded as some of the best times to visit Denver. The best times to visit Denver if you're on a tight budget are April through May and October through mid-December, when there are usually fewer tourists. These off-seasons offer more options at restaurants and resorts than summer and winter, as well as less traffic on the notoriously congested I-70 mountain corridor. December through February is the ideal time to go if you enjoy winter activities. Nevertheless, January and February are perhaps the greatest months to ski in Colorado. There's plenty of off-mountain fun to be had, and the snow is usually lovely and deep (and still falling). </p>
