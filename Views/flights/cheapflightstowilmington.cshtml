            <ul>
                <li>The year-round coastal climate of Wilmington is attractive. However, the peak seasons to visit are slightly better in the spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) seasons since the weather is warm, breezy, and perfect for the beaches and sightseeing in the city’s historic downtown. </li>
                <li>The summer season ranges between warm and hot, which is more favourable to the vacation crusaders going to the beaches as it has a higher tendency for expensive travel and an excess of tourists. </li>
                <li>The winter season is when things are tamer and those looking forward to the cheaper rates for air tickets and hotel accommodation are best suited. </li>

                <li><b>Historic Downtown Wilmington:</b> This is famous for its waterfront, beautiful boutiques, restaurants, the famous Riverwalk, and many more.</li>
                <li><b>Battleship North Carolina:</b> A museum exhibiting a World War II battleship that immerses one into the American experience of the navy.</li>
                <li><b>Airlie Gardens:</b> Beautiful garden areas with collections of different flowers on display, statues, and serene walking trails enjoyed for leisurely walks.</li>
