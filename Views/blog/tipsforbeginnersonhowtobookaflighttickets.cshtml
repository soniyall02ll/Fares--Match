                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Research Top Travel Sites:</strong> Getting yourself a genuine booking is only possible from a very credible website. Do not rush into a booking just out of pure excitement. Instead, research all your travel booking sites and book from the best one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Look For Flights That Have Stopovers:</strong> Often when flying, you are subjected to the nastiest layovers. Some layovers can extend to twenty-four hours even. Have fun during that by just booking airlines that have stopover policies. In this policy, you get many free touring and lounging benefits offered by the airline.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Buy Travel Insurance:</strong> Booking your flight is more convenient and safe when you have travel insurance. In case you have your flight ticket canceled due to unforeseen circumstances, this travel insurance will come to your immediate rescue for sure.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Look For Credit Card Benefits:</strong> Often your credit card company will have a tie-up with an airline, and booking that airline's flight with your card will ensure you a hefty benefit for sure.
