            <p class="text-justify">The area was once under the control of the native Arawak tribe. The first European settlers arrived here in the late fifteenth century.

Fancy restaurants, hotels, and shopping centres add to the city’s glamorous lifestyle. A famous attraction in the town is the Palmer Plantation.
