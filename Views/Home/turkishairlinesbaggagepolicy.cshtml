            <p class="text-justify">Turkish Air is the major airline of the United States and Turkey as well. For the European Airlines, you can fly with this airline without any issue. When it comes to check the information about the baggage policy overview of the airline then we can say that <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/turkish-airlines.aspx">Turkish Airlines Baggage Policy</a>is visible on the website of Turkish Air and from this site you can explore the terms and conditions of baggage policy. </p>
            <h2 class="text-justify">You Can Carry One Carry-On Item and One Personal Item:  </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">For both economy class and business class you can avail the facility of one personal item and one carry-on item free of cost in the baggage policy of<a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/turkish-airlines.aspx">Turkish Airlines</a>. That means you don’t have need to pay money for the baggage of one personal item and one carry-on item. </p>
            <h2 class="text-justify">80 USD is Fee for Checked Bags: </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">On the other hand, if you travel with the checked bags then you need to pay the 80 USD Fee but this fee is also not applicable in the first class and business class flyers because 2 checked bags are allowed with the overweight and oversize limit in this airline. If you want to know more about the baggage policy of the airline then you must dial the Turkish Airlines Customer Service because customer service phone number of the airline is working 24 hours. </p>
