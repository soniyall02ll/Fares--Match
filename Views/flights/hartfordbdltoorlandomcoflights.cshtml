            <h2>The best time to visit Orlando</h2>

            <p>March through May is the prime travel season in Orlando. At that time of year, travel and hotel costs are at their most reasonable (holiday weekends and school breaks excepted), and the weather is at its most beautiful, with most days reaching highs of 50 to 80 degrees. Fall is also the busiest season for Florida's hurricane season, from June to November. Similarly, September to mid-November is a good time to visit, with pleasant weather and affordable flights from Orlando to Hartford. </p>

            <p>The summer is the worst time to visit the area because of the state's intense heat and humidity and the fact that hotel accommodations use the school break to raise accommodation costs. Additionally, prices are higher from late November to February when families travel to the area to celebrate the holidays and visit grandparents. </p>
