            <h2>Air Carriers Flying from the Bahamas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Several airlines have flights to the <b>Bahamas Airport</b>, and these link it to different parts of the U.S., Canada, and even the Caribbean. </li>
                <li>Bahamas air, which is the national carrier, has direct flights to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Orlando. American Airlines, Delta, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/jetblue-airlines.aspx"><b>JetBlue Airlines</b></a>, and United Services are other airlines that operate to the Bahamas from their main cities. </li>
                <li>Vacationers from other countries may also use British airlines to travel between Nassau and their London offices. </li>
                <li>There are many offers on all these airlines. FaresMatch ensures you get the cheapest <b>flight to the Bahamas</b> at your preferred time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Airfare Charges</h2>
            <p>The prices of the <b>airline tickets to the Bahamas</b> are not the same at all times for different states and different airlines. A round trip to the Bahamas from the USA would roughly cost $200 to $500 for the average traveller, and the cost is usually low during the low season.</p>
            <p>Additionally, direct flights from Miami or Fort Lauderdale tend to be cheaper than those originating from the northern or western states. With FaresMatch, you can also compare the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>airfare tickets</b></a>, and discounts will alert you if there is a better fare than yours for your given date or if you are planning to travel some time in the future.</p>

            <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Most tourists pour into the Bahamas between the months of December and April, when the temperatures are warm, sunny, and less humid, making it the most favourable weather for outdoor and beach activities. </li>
                <li>This time also happens to be high season, meaning the costs of aeroplane tickets are likely to be on the higher side. </li>
                <li>For those travelling on a tight budget, it is worth considering travelling when the rush is over between the months of May and November, when the fares on flying and booking hotels often crease. </li>
                <li>FaresMatch will assist in sourcing the best flight deals to the Bahamas on peak or off-peak seasons to enable you to agenda your travel arrangements within your pocket.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Top Five Tourist Attractions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Nassau:</b> The capital city of Nassau has a little bit of everything when it comes to Bahamian culture, history, and shopping. Go to the Queen’s staircase, visit the local markets, or just lie down on the Cable Beach, which is not too far.</li>
                <li><b>Exuma Cays:</b> Best known for their swimming pigs, the Exuma Cays are also a great place to go for more than just eating food. Go island hopping, swim in clear waters, and go underwater and have fun playing with fish.</li>
                <li><b>Paradise Island:</b> Renowned for its Atlantis Resort, Paradise Island is preferred for family fun, luxurious activities, and exciting water sports such as waterparks and aquariums.</li>
                <li><b>Andros Island:</b> For the lovers of nature, Andros is a paradise with its numerous blue holes, diverse habitats, and one of the longest coral reefs, complementing the snorkelling and scuba activities.</li>
                <li><b>Harbour Island:</b> The Pink Sand Beach, which is the greatest draw to Harbour Island, is Hill Street’s most lightly populated yet most scenic of its beaches, making it the perfect way to unwind and enjoy quiet reflective walks along the shoreline.</li>
            </ul>
