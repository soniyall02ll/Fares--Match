            <p>Once the home of the Kumeyaay tribe, the inhabitants of this area of North America, Europeans first settled here in the sixteenth century. After three centuries of Spanish rule, the city came under the United States of America. However, one can still witness significant glimpses of Spanish culture and influence today.

            <p>Boston is another of the oldest and most well-known cities in America.

At the same time, it has been an essential centre of law, medicine, and finance for centuries. The city’s inhabitants are also famous for their philanthropic and altruistic efforts. </p>
