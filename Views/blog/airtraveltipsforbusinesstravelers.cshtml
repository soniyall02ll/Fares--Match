                <p>Traditionally, most airlines had stuck to the two-tier airline class system which consisted of first class and economy class. The business class had been envisioned as an intermediary class of the two – often called a compromise. Since then, multiple airlines have implemented their policies and the business class has seen many changes over the years. </p>
                <p>At present, the <a href="https://faresmatch.com/business-class.aspx"><b>business class</b></a> is often considered the best class of service on a plan. This is due to the increasing trend of removing first-class service on flights and using business class as its replacement. Interestingly, many airlines have now also introduced the idea of premium economy which acts as an intermediary between the business and economy classes. </p>
                <h2>Advantages of the Business Class</h2>
                <p>Many travellers prefer to opt for the business class as it offers them many comforts that are not available in the normal economy or even premium economy classes without charging the exorbitant rates of the first class. Simply put, this class offers the golden middle ground between the opulence of the first class and the simplicity of the economy class. </p>
                <p>Business class offers multiple specific advantages and services including larger leg space. In some flights, it is extended to provide more space for any carry-on bags you may have brought on board. The food, drinks and services provided by airlines to passengers with business-class <a href="https://faresmatch.com"><b>flight tickets</b></a> are of significantly more sophisticated quality. </p>
                <h2>Airlines Providing Business class Flights</h2>
                <p>Almost all major airlines all over the world provide business classes. The idea was first envisioned and implemented by the Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij Royal Dutch Airlines, the flag carrier of the Netherlands and known as Full Fare Facilities (FFF). Many other airlines followed suit and customized the class to fit their visions finally leading to the formation of the modern business class of service. </p>

                <p>A list of airlines which provide business class service includes the following names: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Qantas and Air Virginia from Australia</li>
                    <li>Air New Zealand from New Zealand</li>
                    <li>Air Canada from Canada</li>
                    <li>American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines of the United States of America</li>
                    <li>Air France from France </li>
                    <li>Lufthansa from Germany.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Recently some airlines have been giving up on the business class of service for either domestic and short haul flights or completely in favour of discount economy. Some airlines however prefer to use blocked middle seats, curtains, partitions and special recliner seats to indicate business class seats and services. </p>
                <h3>Replacements for Business-class Services</h3>
                <p>Those airlines which have decided to stop providing business class seats offer a vast array of separate services to act as an alternative. These alternative privileges include those granted under programmes like Even More Space by JetBlue, Space+ by Air New Zealand, Big From Seats by Spirit Airlines and Hot Seats by Air Asia. These programmes provide special services such as more legroom, more comfortable seats and precedence while boarding. </p>

                <h4>FAQs</h4>

                <h5>What is the cost of a business-class flight ticket? </h5>
                <p>The cost of a business class flight ticket is varied and depends to a great extent on the airlines providing it. They are usually costlier than economy tickets and customers have an additional problem as prices of business class seats generally do not fall under any flight deals meaning travellers can not opt for special discounts of any kind. </p>
                <h5>What are the environmental concerns surrounding business classes? </h5>
                <p>The environmental concerns surrounding business classes include the large quantities of greenhouse gases emitted by the aircraft. Due to the greater amount of space between seats, business class emits larger quantities of greenhouse gases while providing services to fewer people. These gases pose a great threat to the environment and consequently, human life due to the dangerous effects of increased carbon dioxide in the air. </p>
