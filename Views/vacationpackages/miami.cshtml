            <h3>Grab Best Deals On British Airways</h3>
            <p>Below are some tricks that will allow you to make the most out of your British Airways tickets. </p>

            <p><b>Book in advance: </b></p>
            <p>In most cases, it is true that the earlier you can book your flight, the cheaper it is. However, this is only sometimes the case though. In case a situation arises where the demand for the flight isn't as high as BA expected, then automatic pricing tends to kick in. </p>

            <p>As a result, the price tends to reduce to meet the demand. On the other hand, a sale could push the price down further. The worst thing you can do is book a really last-minute flight. They are almost always more expensive, especially in Business Class or First. </p>

            <p><b>Flying during the off-season: </b></p>
            <p>Flight prices tend to be the most expensive during the peak season. Off-peak flights are the cheapest. This greatly depends on the destination you fly to rather than on where you fly from. If you can pass off-peak, you have a greater chance of getting a cheaper BA flight. </p>

            <p><b>Collecting Avios: </b></p>
            <p>One of the best ways to get the cheapest BA flight fares is to collect Avios and use them either wholly or partly towards the airfare. If you didn't know, Avios is the air miles program of which British Airways are a part. </p>
