                <h2>Places you must visit in Ecuador</h2>


                <h3>Quito</h3>
                <p>Ecuador's capital, Quito, is perched 2,850 meters above sea level on the Andean foothills. The city is worth spending at least two to three days in, if not more, as it has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Savor a delicious Empanada de Viento, explore the best-preserved Old Town in Latin America, and admire the expansive city views from the Basilica Del Voto Nacional. Beautiful Quito is full of history, cuisine, art, and, most importantly, warm, kind people.</p>


                <h3>Cuenca</h3>
                <p>Cuenca is a bustling city with enough to offer visitors in terms of historic architecture, rich culture, and mouthwatering food. Taking a wandering, aimless stroll with your camera is the best way to discover. Take in the breathtaking blue spires of the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception, stop by Calderon Park for some ice cream and people-watching, and visit the Panama Hat Museum to learn the real story behind the famous straw fedora.</p>


                <h3>Amazon Jungle</h3>
                <p>The Amazon jungle covers eight countries, including Ecuador. Its 1.6 billion acres of deep forest are spectacular in every way, not the least of which is the home to millions, yes millions, of species, such as pink dolphins, jaguars, and sloths. You'll have plenty of opportunities to view wildlife when combined with the myriad of plants, fish, and reptiles that call it home.</p>


                <h3>Galapagos Island</h3>
                <p>From Quito, it's just a hop, skip, and a 2.5-hour journey to one of the most amazing locations on the planet. The Galápagos Islands are renowned for their amazing biological diversity and are a haven for animal enthusiasts. Imagine hundreds of different species of fish, blue-footed boobies, gigantic tortoises, sea lions, iguanas, flamingos, finches, and more. What is the most effective approach to view each of these creatures? There are lots of things you can do, such as discover the red sand beaches of Rábida, snorkel at Isabela Island, and stroll the footpaths at Darwin Bay.</p>


                <h3>The Pacific Coast</h3>
                <p>Start or conclude your journey with a jump across to coastal treasures like Guayaquil, Esmeraldas, Salinas, Montañita, and Machalilla to fully enjoy what Ecuador has to offer. The Pacific Coast is a melting pot of culture and gorgeous beaches that will leave you with a lifetime of unforgettable memories and salty air in your lungs. Discover the energetic metropolis of Guayaquil, unwind on beaches with golden sand in Salinas, savor the delectable fresh food of Esmeraldas, hone your surfing abilities on the waves of Montañita, and indulge in a mud bath in the sulfur lagoon at Agua Blanca within Machalilla National Park.</p>

                <h2>Getting to Ecuador with JetBlue</h2>

                <h2>Best time to visit according to Months</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Pacific Coast and the Galápagos Islands experience mild weather from December to February, which also offers the finest underwater visibility for those who have scheduled snorkeling or scuba diving excursions. It is advisable to make advance plans if you wish to come during big holidays as prices tend to increase and accommodations can be difficult to find.</li>
                    <li>The Coast and the Galápagos archipelago continue to offer ideal surfing and diving conditions from March to May. As they arrive for hatching season, visitors to the islands can expect to see blue-footed boobies, tortoises, iguanas, and albatrosses daily. The ideal time of year to view the wildlife and flora is now when some birds that hide from the heat during the dry season are most visible. </li>
                    <li>Ecuador's highlands are at their best from June to September, when sunny days and Andean summer holidays contribute to their prosperity. Travelers from both domestic and foreign countries love this time of year because of the clear skies, pleasant weather, and abundance of cultural events.</li>
                    <li>October and November in the Amazon region have less consistent weather due to the change in seasons. The shoulder season is here, which makes it the best time to visit the rainforest while avoiding more intense downpours and flooding. This season brings with it gentle morning mists and drizzles along the Coast and in the Galápagos Islands, a sign of warmer days to come.</li>
                </ul>
