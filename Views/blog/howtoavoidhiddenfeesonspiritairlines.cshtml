                <p>Spirit is a popular choice for travellers in the United States. Are you looking to buy the airline tickets of Spirit? Do you know about the hidden fees or charges of the airline? Well, the airline offers the lowest airfare to the passengers, but there are so many hidden charges or fees of the airline that you need to pay. This is an ultra-low-cost airline for budget travel and offers low fares with some hidden fees for extras such as seat selection, onboard services and baggage. Therefore, here are all the major tips that you need to know to avoid the hidden fees on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/spirit-airlines-flights.aspx"><b>Spirit Airlines flights</b></a>.</p>
                <h2>1. Understand Spirit Airlines’ Pricing Model</h2>
                <p>First you need to understand the pricing model of the airline. Check all the major fees, such as baggage fees, seat selection fees or any other, at Spirit Airlines' official website. There are many extra services by the airline, including the food as well as the plane, that you need to pay for if you get these services. The pro-tip for the flyers is to become familiar with Spirit Airlines policies on the official website to avoid any surprises.</p>
                <h2>2. Pack Smart and Light</h2>
                <p>The next thing is to pack smart and light. Baggage fee is a burden on the flyers but if you pack smartly during the travel, then you can avail many benefits on saving baggage fee. The airline allows one free personal item that fits under the seat in front of you but charges for carry-on and checked baggage. To avoid these fees, pack only essentials and use a small bag that meets Spirit’s size requirements (18 x 14 x 8 inches). You can also use the compression packing cubes to maximize the space in your items.</p>
                <h2>3. Skip Seat Selection</h2>
                <p>If you love cost-saving over your comfort, then seat selection is not necessary for you. Therefore, the airline charges for seat selection, with fees varying based on the seat location and comfort level. You can save money by getting an assigned seat on Spirit Airlines. If you are travelling for short-haul flights, then you must skip this part.</p>
                <h2>4. Bring Your Snacks and Drinks</h2>
                <p>Next, you need to carry your food, drink and snacks because if you order food at the aircraft,, then you need to pay the extra charges, which are overpriced. Hence, bring your snacks and drinks to avoid any charges.</p>
                <h2>5. Check-In Online</h2>
                <p>If you choose the online check-in then you can save your money at the check-in counter of the airport. You must avoid this fee by doing the online check-in and printing your board pass at home.</p>
                <h2>6. Beware of Additional Services and Upgrades</h2>
                <p>The airline also offers add-ons like priority boarding flights, flexibility and insurance. These are the useful tips that you need to follow to avoid any unnecessary services to save more.</p>
                <h2>7. Use Spirit’s $9 Fare Club</h2>
                <p>The frequent flyers of Spirit Airlines can also join the $9 Fare Club, and this leads to savings on Fares and baggage fees. The membership is $69 of the Spirit Airlines Club, and you can also travel with the airline multiple times a year.</p>
                <h2>8. Pay Attention to Spirit’s Policies</h2>
                <p>You must be familiar with the policies of Spirit Airlines on the different fees.

                <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
