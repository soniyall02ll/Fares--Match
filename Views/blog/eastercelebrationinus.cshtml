                <p class="text-justify">Easter marks the beginning of spring and provides a long weekend off work to enjoy festivals, flowers, breakfast, or a weekend getaway. Easter is jam-packed with activities for the whole family, including egg hunts, carnivals, live music, and food festivals. Visit the USA to celebrate this festival with your loved ones.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Easter family <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/vacations.aspx">vacations </a>have grown in popularity in recent years, and it's simple to see why. Many of the more popular destinations aren't as crowded as they are during the summer holidays, and the weather is still pleasant but not oppressively so. If a change of scenery sounds like the perfect way to spend the Easter holiday, here are a few spots that are especially attractive in the springtime and have plenty to do throughout the long weekend. </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Washington DC</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">A trip to Washington, D.C. allows you to participate in one of the country's most well-known Easter traditions: rolling Easter eggs on the White House lawn, which dates back to the late 1800s. To go, you must win a ticket lottery that begins a few weeks before Easter, so cross your fingers and hope for the best. While the cherry blossoms are usually at their peak early in the month, there's a good possibility you'll see some of the city's most famous sites wrapped in pink. You'll find enough to do in any case, from the Smithsonian's National Zoo to a plethora of museums. So, book a flight to Washington today. </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Royal Hawaiian</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Travel to the Hawaiian Islands to unwind and enjoy the tropical sun, swimming, surfing, and spa treatments. The Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki is home to the Abhasa Waikiki Spa. Massages, body treatments, facials, and hair care are just a few of the services provided by the spa. If you wish to enjoy your massage outside in the garden, make sure you schedule your appointment in advance. Japanese, Swedish, Hawaiian, and other international therapies are available to guests. $110 for a 50-minute Lomi Lomi massage, and $55 for a 25-minute Hawaiian Sea Salt Scrub. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Easter week is a popular time to visit Orlando and Disney World since the event brings a variety of special spring festivals to the Sunshine State. Parades, games, Easter egg hunts, Easter-themed arts & crafts, meet-and-greets with Mr. and Mrs. Easter Bunny in Town Square on Main Street, U.S.A., and even Easter services will be held. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">During the weeks preceding up to Easter, the Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival is held, with oversized Easter eggs adorned with Disney characters scattered around World Showcase. You'll be able to purchase a special map with stickers for noting your egg finds which you can then turn in for a prize when you're through. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">New York</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Book a flight to New York. The Easter parade in New York City is unrivaled in terms of spectacle. It starts after the Easter service at St. Patrick's Cathedral and continues for several hours down Fifth Avenue. Participants are invited to be creative by constructing their own Easter bonnets for this one-of-a-kind parade. There will also be a Barnyard Egg Hunt, Pysanky Ukrainian Easter Egg Decoration Workshops, and the Macy's Flower Show, among many other activities. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Chicago</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Over the Easter weekend, the Windy City provides a variety of entertaining attractions and events, including several large Easter egg hunts in local parks. If you're bringing Fido or Fluffy, come to Horner Park for the Doggie Egg Hunt, where Fido or Fluffy may hunt for treat-filled eggs. Along with Chicago's world-class attractions like Shedd Aquarium and the Art Institute of Chicago, there will be plenty of delicious Easter brunches and other special dinners to select from. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Santa Barbara, California</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Easter Weekend is a great time to go glamping! Grab your family and do airline booking to the El Capitan Canyon luxury camping resort in the Santa Ynez Valley for a special Easter brunch buffet, as well as a 3,000-egg hunt that will be rounded off by a visit from Easter Bunny. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Fredericksburg</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Fredericksburg, Texas is noted for its long-standing German heritage, which dates back to the town's establishment in 1847. On the night before Easter, everyone in Fredericksburg dresses up for the Easter pageant, and the lights all go out at a set time of night. Visitors can enjoy the unique and amusing spectacle of the Fredericksburg Easter Fires from the hills surrounding the town, where they can see the lights of the fires that have sprung up in the distance. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Caribbean Cruise</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Take the family on a Caribbean cruise for an Easter vacation that will be remembered. Cruise lines like Royal Caribbean are excellent choices for a family vacation because they offer a variety of activities for children on board as well as a variety of family-friendly onshore excursions. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Each day, you'll wake up at sea in a new area with something new to discover and explore. The FlowRider® surf simulators and the tallest slide at sea, Ultimate AbyssSM, are available on Royal Caribbean ships, as are bumper cars, crazy golf, arcades, the RipCord® by iFLY® simulator, rock climbing walls, laser tag, waterparks – the list goes on and on, and the hardest part is deciding what to do next! </p>
