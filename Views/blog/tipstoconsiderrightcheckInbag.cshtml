On the other hand, extended vacations or international travel require a larger bag of 24-to-26-inch suitcases that offers ample room or space for clothes, shoes, and other stuff. Family travel needs larger bags, and you must consider larger bags with multiple compartments to distribute your stuff perfectly. </p>
                <p>Before going on a trip, you must check the airline baggage policy to avoid any hassles at the airport. </p>

Soft-sided bags are great for the over-packers. If you choose a water-resistant material to secure your belongings. </p>
                <h2>3. Wheels: Two vs. Four</h2>

Hence, if you want to make your travel experience convenient, then you must check the quality of the wheels that you are going to buy. There are different types of bags, such as two wheels and four wheels. Two-wheel bags are compact, sturdy, and ideal for uneven surfaces. On the other hand, four-wheel bags offer 360-degree mobility and have smooth surfaces. </p>
                <h2>4. Compartments and Organization</h2>
                <p>Make sure that you pack your bag very well because unorganized bags are not appropriate and good packing helps you to travel without any hassles.
