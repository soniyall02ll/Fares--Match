            <h2>Understanding Air Canada's Change Flights Policy</h2>
            <p>You may take comfort in knowing that one can book, rebook, and even change a flight with an Air Canada fare even at the very last minute. However, you should understand the few exceptions that exist that pertain to the rules of the specific fare type you have purchased since it can determine the penalties or restrictions applicable to your alteration. In most instances, when you buy your airfare tickets with no middlemen and directly from Air Canada, the flight information is normally contained on the Air Canada Manage Booking page.</p>
