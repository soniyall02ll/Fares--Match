On the other hand, popular, the capital city of Texas is famous for its lively music, technological sector, and relaxed culture. The town hosts musical festivals such as the South by Southwest (SXSW) and the Austin City Limits festivals, showcasing both new and well-established artists. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Austin boasts some of the finest restaurants specializing in barbecue, Tex-Mex, and the city's famed food trailers.
