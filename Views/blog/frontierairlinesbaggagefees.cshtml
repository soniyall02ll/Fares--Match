                <p>2. You need to use the bundles because the airline also offers bundles like “The Works” and “The Perks,” and this includes a carry-on and checked bag, potentially saving you money.</p>
                <p>3. You must check the size and weight limits first because you need to ensure that your bag meets Frontier Airline size and weight restrictions to avoid any additional fees.</p>
                <p>4. You must consider the Elite Status; if you have and are a frequent flyer can benefit from Frontier Elite status. This offers complimentary baggage allowances.</p>
