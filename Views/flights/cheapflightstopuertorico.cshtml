            <p class="text-justify">The beautiful island of Puerto Rico awaits your arrival. With its stunning beaches and rich culture, it will dazzle the eyes of all who set foot on it. The island is also well known for its unique culture and distinct identity. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The first settlers on the island arrived a couple of thousand years ago. Despite suffering colonization at the hands of the Spanish in the fifteenth century, the indigenous population preserved their culture to a great extent. Today, you might experience a part of their rich history through watching the Festival Nacional Indigena. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The island is also well known for its rich reserves of native plant and animal life. The Luquillo Biosphere Reserve and the Guanica Biosphere Reserve are home to many endemic plant species, such as the higo chumbo cactus, and animal species, such as the Puerto Rican boa, Puerto Rican sharp-skinned hawk, and the Mona ground iguana. Guided kayak tours through Puerto Mosquito Bioluminescent Bay can only be described as a dream come true. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Puerto Rico also houses monuments in various architectural styles ranging from La Fortaleza, designed in the sixteenth century, to the only actual building in the Gothic style of architecture in all of America, the San José church and the Yaguez theatre, and the San Juan cathedral built in the early twentieth century in the elaborate Baroque style. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The best way to book <b>cheap flights to Puerto Rico</b> is by maintaining flexibility in the schedule. Booking tickets as early as possible is advisable to get the best deals and offers. This helps travelers avoid last-minute costly tickets. </p>
