            <h2>Finding out the Greatest in Toronto</h2>
            <p>Toronto is a vibrant and alive city of diversity—always fascinating—mixing a dizzying spot of cultures, cuisines, and experiences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Indeed, high as the spire of the city stands the CN Tower above its skyline. It towers over 1,800 feet, thus affording one with an incomparably spectacular bird’s-eye view of the city of Toronto and the beautiful walls of Lake Ontario surrounding it.</li>
                <li>From the contemporary art that The Power Plant presents to the Islamic treasures of the Aga Khan Museum, and the footwear history that the Bata Shoe Museum showcases, art and culture lovers will explore Toronto's different scenes. Innovative exhibitions can be found in the MOCA and the Toronto Sculpture Garden, while The Art of Banksy will invite street art intrigue.</li>
                <li>With a theatre and music scene almost as vibrant as the city itself, Broadway shows would gyrate in the Theatre District while a live concert might be experienced at one of those many venues around the city. </li>
                <li>Kensington Market is not left out as it adds to its list of bohemian neighbourhoods, with all kinds of eclectic shops, vintage boutiques, and international eateries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Diverse Neighborhoods In Toronto</h3>
            <p>Toronto is a city within itself, with separate chunks, each of which resonates with a different kind of charm and atmosphere.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The city’s huge expanse of Chinamounts is well known as Asia Town. Purely in Asian themes, Chinese restaurants, herbal medicine shops, and traditional markets can be found combining into an electrifying clustering. Here, you can be a visitor to the streets, tasting dim sums and immersing yourself in sounds and sights in one of the lively neighbourhoods.</li>
                <li>Just for something a bit more artsy and historical, why don’t you pop over to the Distillery District? This is a pedestrian-only area, characterised by the cobbled streets of bygone days, along with the Victorian buildings and art galleries. There is, thus, the charm of the old world with a good dollop of modern creativity: perfect for that day out, evening cocktails, or sundowner with friends.</li>
                <li>High Park will be the answer for anyone who wants preferred green spaces. This park occupies a total acreage of 400 acres in the middle of the city. It boasts trails that can be walked on, picnic spots, and even a zoo and serves as an ideal place to relax, bringing peace to the city.</li>
            </ul>
