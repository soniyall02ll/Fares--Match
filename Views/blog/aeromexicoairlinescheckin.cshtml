                <h3>Oversold flights</h3>
                Flights are often oversold, and passengers who check in at the last minute do not get a seat, which increases their risk of being bumped from the flight. It would be best to check in early to avoid this situation.
                <h3>Skip check in if you don't have luggage.</h3>
                <p>On the other hand, if you don't have luggage, you can skip the check in desk and head directly to security to catch the flight. This benefits flyers who only carry one personal item and one hand luggage.</p>
                <h3>Check in 24 hours before departure</h3>
                <p>Passengers flying with Aeromexico Airlines must check in online at least 24 hours before departure to avoid all last-minute hassles.</p>
                <h3>How early can I check in for an Aeromexico flight online?</h3>
                <p>This is another central question for flyers because sometimes they don't know how early they can check in on Aeromexico Airlines. Hence, the airline check in counter is open 24 hours before the flight. Some airlines also open the window up to 35 hours before the flight. Passengers can check in 24 hours before departure and 48 hours for international flights.</p>
