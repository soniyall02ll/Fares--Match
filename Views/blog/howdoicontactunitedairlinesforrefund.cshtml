                <p class="text-justify">Are you thinking to cancel the flight tickets or United Flights because of some reason? Had you cancel the tickets of United Air but don’t able to know <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>how do I contact United Airlines for refund</b></a>?  Well, it is the major question behind the travellers because sometimes they don’t know about the refund process or they are thinking that they are not eligible for the refund. Passengers can get refund from the United Airlines Flights (if they follow the airline terms and eligible for the refund) easily by following the easy steps. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">Submit a Request For Refund: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">The first thing to get the refund by cancelling the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>United Airlines Tickets</b></a> for the passengers is submitting a request for refund. This task will be done at the United Airlines Website.  On the website you can choose the option of “Refund Request”. With this, you can view the booking details (Including your booking number, last name, travel date and personal information). Now, click on the submit tab to submit your request to the United Airlines Customer Service Team for the refund on the United Airlines Ticket Cancellation. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">Chat Support is also available: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">If you are not able to send request for refund then you can also get the live chat support at the United Airlines Official Site. You can chat with the team of customer service about the refund terms and they will help you immediately. Chat and Phone Call both are the right option for you to contact United Airlines for refund. </p>
