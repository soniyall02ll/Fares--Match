                After rebranding and re-launching from the bankrupt Gulfstream International Airlines, the
                airline was created in 2011. The airline began by focusing on flights between Florida and the
                Bahamas, later expanding to other sections of the United States and, eventually, the Caribbean
                islands.
            </p>
