                <p class="text-justify">Delta Airlines is a low-cost Airline. However, due to an increase in fuel prices and low availability of services, the Airline had to increase its fares. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">But now, the Airline focuses on the convenience of their passengers and has made many changes in their policies to provide flight tickets at cheap fares. Below are some details on cheap flight ticket fares. </p>

                <h2>Reasons Why Delta Tickets were Expensive</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Delta Airlines is not a luxurious Airline, yet it used to charge high fare tickets. The reason for Delta tickets being expensive is-</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>There is no other airline to compete with Delta Airlines; when there is no competition, the business will set a price in any way they want. Some customers may remain loyal to the Airline, but some of them might look after saving money and switch to other Airlines. In this way, the Airline will be forced to lower its prices to compete. </li>
                    <li>Delta Airlines has no child discounts. They charge children the same as adults, unlike other Airlines. Hence it is expensive as they do not offer child discounts and charge fees on overweight items. </li>
                    <li>There were limited discounts on senior citizens and no military discounts for veterans. But now, Delta offers vacation packages at a discount rate to active military members. </li>
                    <li>The supply of plane tickets is low during holidays since many people travel during that time and many workers take some time off during holidays. Hence there was limited availability of supply. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Changes made by Delta Airlines and how it is helpful to travellers</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Delta Airlines have made many changes to help customers with <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/delta-flight-tickets-at-cheap-fare.aspx">cheap Delta flights</a>. The travellers are happy with the changes.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Airline has extended their tickets through the end of next year. </li>
                    <li>Delta Airlines' primary motive was to remove uncertainty when customers weren't sure whether to spend money on flight tickets or not. </li>
                    <li>Under the new extended ticket of the Airline, a plane ticket has to be reissued by the end of next year for its use throughout 2024. </li>
                    <li>Previously, if any passenger wanted to cancel their flight or wanted to change their refundable ticket, then a fee of $250 was charged. If anyone paid $400 for a roundtrip. </li>
                    <li>The Airline has now eliminated the fees associated with changing travel plans and cancellations and extending the time they have to use a ticket's value, giving much flexibility to the travellers. </li>
                    <li>The changes are subject to the Basic Economy fares as well. But those tickets are subjected to cancellation fees according to the updated guidelines. </li>
                    <li>Therefore, people are now encouraged to buy plane tickets for the planned trip as they know that if things are changed, they won't lose anything. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How can the travellers rebook and save when the prices of Delta Airlines drop</h4>
