                <h4>Correct time to book a flight to California</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">To find the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-california.aspx">cheapest flights to California</a>, booking your flights at least six months in advance is best. If you need more flexibility to plan long-term, allow at least seven weeks before booking your flight to California. When flying to California, consider events like the Academy Awards. It will increase the price significantly. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you're arriving in Los Angeles, sit on the plane's right side for great views of the Hollywood Sign, the L.A.

                <h4>Traveling tips</h4>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Items that you cannot carry in luggage</strong>
                <p class="text-justify">Explosive and combustible materials are prohibited in hand and checked baggage on all airlines. Gas burners, firecrackers, and barbecue fires are among these things. For safety reasons, you cannot carry anything used as a weapon in your hand luggage (what you bring on the plane). Example: sharp scissors, tool, bottle opener. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Packing is an art</strong>
                <p class="text-justify">Each airline has its own rules regarding the size and weight of hand luggage and checked luggage. Baggage that exceeds these limits will cost you a lot at the airport, so it's essential to avoid taking it with you. Most airlines allow you to carry a second, smaller bag with your carry-on, such as a handbag or a backpack containing a laptop. Lock your bags so you can easily take them out at security. You should keep your airplane tickets safe. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"><strong>Each country has its laws</strong>
                <p class="text-justify">In the European Union, customs regulations for transporting alcohol, tobacco, food, and plants are the same in most countries. When leaving the E.U., each country has its own rules. The fine for traveling with contraband and carrying specific products also varies according to the regulations of each country. The mildest type of punishment is to destroy the goods. However, many countries in the Middle East impose heavy fines on transporting alcohol. </p>
                <p><strong>Keep your phone in airplane mode</strong>
                <p class="text-justify">More and more, we read articles that cell phones do not interfere with the operation of airplanes, but most airlines prohibit the use of cell phones during flights. The exception to this rule is using mobile phones in airplane mode. It is available for most types of phones. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Security measures are constantly changing due to changing laws and events that can increase the level of risk. There are people in wheelchairs and people with allergies. Delays, cancellations, or mechanical conditions may change baggage allowance or the number of seats available on the aircraft. Weather problems may occur in another city that may change your plans or the town you are in. Get to know about cheap flight deals while booking a flight and get cheap airline reservations.</p>
