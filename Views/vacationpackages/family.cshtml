            <h2>The Top Family Getaway Spots</h2>
            <p>Thanks to world-famous theme parks, family-focused resorts and endless entertainment, Orlando, Florida, is always a first choice.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From Disney World to LEGOLAND, Orlando is loaded with family fun. Conversely, Yellowstone National Park is an immersive experience for nature, with hiking, wildlife viewing, and low-profile family bonding time. </li>
                <li>Washington, D.C., combines learning and fun through interactive museums, monuments, and national parks. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Great for that active family, nature parks and hiking trails – such as Yosemite, Zion, or the Smoky Mountains – have something great in store for family members: hiking, biking, or horseback riding in breathtaking scenery, for example, a family beach vacation. </li>
                <li>The kids build sandcastles, enjoy snorkelling, or participate in the resort-run activities while parents are relaxing. The hotels or resorts often offer these as family packages that tend to ease the itinerary.</li>
                <li>From boat tours to cooking classes or wildlife safaris, different ages find something worthwhile to keep each busy. Cruises are also an option, particularly the family ones with onboard waterparks, movie nights, and supervised clubs for kids.</li>
