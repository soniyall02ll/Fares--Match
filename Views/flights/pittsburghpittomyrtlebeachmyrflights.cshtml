            <p class="text-justify">Catching a flight to Myrtle Beach? Discover a golfer's paradise by taking a cheap flight from Pittsburgh to Myrtle Beach. Along the Grand Strand, there are almost a hundred courses. Family-friendly mini-golf courses are equally plentiful. Although Ripley's Museum and Ripley's Aquarium are worth seeing, the beach is undoubtedly the primary draw in this location. There are hundreds of fish in the aquarium, and it's designed so you can walk both beside and under the fish. The Wonderwheel opened recently. This enormous Ferris wheel offers a breathtaking perspective of the city and the sea from inside air-conditioned, enclosed vehicles. For the finest experience, you might want to think about riding it twice—during the day and at night. The beach's specialty is seafood. Full-service restaurants like Dockside and buffets like Crabby Mikes or Benjamin's exist. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">If you'd rather have steak, the local favorite is Angelo's. You can take in the Carolina Opry after eating. Alternatively, you may go to Medieval Times or the Dixie Stampede for food and a show. Myrtle Beach lacks a functioning public transit infrastructure. Renting a car is your best option. However, major resorts may offer a shuttle from and to the airport to pick you up after your flights to Myrtle Beach. If you have a reservation at a hotel on the strip, all you have to do to get to the beach is step outside. If your accommodation is inland, consider visiting Myrtle Beach State Park or Huntington Beach, the two state parks.
