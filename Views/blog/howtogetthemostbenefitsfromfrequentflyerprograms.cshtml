                            <p class="text-justify">Frequent flyer programs are one of the first methods used by airlines to gain more and more customer data. Airlines offered special services like lounge access, duty-free shopping, and many more to stand out from the crowd and give competition to gain loyal customers. The flyer program rewards frequent customers with extras and bonuses and provides more benefits and facilities. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Passengers get numerous benefits from frequent flyer programs. Some awards include free tickets, food and beverage perks, or a free upgrade from economy seating to higher seating class. Some airlines also offer elite programs which offer check-in and boarding facilities. Credit cards are also provided, which earn mileage credits when one uses them for purchases. </p>


                            <h2>Try to get the biggest welcome bonus that you can afford</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">You must find a credit card that has a generous welcome bonus. After that, determine whether you can meet or not meet the minimum spend required to earn the bonus. More significant welcome bonuses require higher minimum spending. Therefore, try to review your budget to ensure you can hit that threshold while still satisfying the entire balance when the bill is due. In case you don't, the balance is subject to interest charges, which can eliminate the values of the frequent flyer programs. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Do not try to choose a card simply because it is attractive. You must make sure that the card makes sense for your lifestyle on an ongoing basis. For example, if your preferred airline is united and you rarely fly Delta, applying for a Delta credit card is not the best idea, no matter how attractive the welcome bonus is. </p>

                            <h3>Try to select the proper rewards structure</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">As one starts to use their credit card, frequent flyer miles start to add up. However, not all credit cards earn rewards the same way. Some credit cards offer a flat-rate rewards structure, whereas others are based on where and how one uses the card. Flat-rate cards are simple as one will always know how much they can accumulate when they use the card. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card features a flat-rate structure and offers two miles for every dollar one charges. It doesn't matter what the purchase is and where the transaction has been made. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">With Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, one can earn 5X points on a travel purchase through Chase Ultimate Rewards, 3X points on dining, and 2X on other travel purchases. A tiered-rewards card makes excellent sense if one is confident, they will frequently use their card on purchases with elevated reward rates. A flat-rate rewards card will likely be a better option if this is not the case. </p>

                            <h3>Pay for the group and then recoup</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">It doesn't matter which type of card you get; the accumulation of frequent flyer miles will slow down if one uses them for their expenses. One can add more miles to the pool by paying for other people's expenses. If one uses a card where they can earn two miles for every purchase, then the net miles is 1000. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">
                                If one buys everyone's flights with their card that earns them three points for every dollar, then a total of $3500 and 10500 miles will be in their rewards bank. The primary key is that each person must repay immediately so that one doesn't wind up with a large debt and need to harangue their loved ones for money. Miles and Smiles is the frequent flyer program <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/turkish-airlines.aspx">Turkish Airlines</a>.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Try to consider cashing out the miles</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">If one does not have a specific travel plan, then their miles and frequent flyer program can be put to work in an alternative way. Discover it Miles can easily convert miles into statement credit and covers the cost of other travel purchases from hotel accommodations to car rentals or as cash that one can use for anything they like. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">
                                A question might come to mind: what is the frequent flyer number? The answer is that it is a number used to identify a customer who regularly travels by plane with a specific airline. Emirates Skywards is the frequent flyer program Emirates.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Try to Economize to Maximize</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">When one redeems their points for flights, one usually gets the choice to select the full range of seat classes that is from basic economy up to business or first class. The lower the price, the fewer miles one has to use to book their flights only if one is interested in stretching their miles to the fullest potential. One does not need to compromise luxury and comfort. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Travel credits also come with other benefits that make the travel experience special and unique. The United Explorer Card offers two one-day passes to the United Club each year for one's card anniversary. A $100 credit is also offered every four years for the Global Entry or TSA Pre-Check application fee, allowing one to breeze through security lines. </p>


                            <h3>Splurging when going the distance</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">This does not indicate that one should automatically reject the comfort and elegance of flying on a business or first class. Try to weigh the miles-cost before booking. Try to concentrate on flights where there is a need for extra legroom and other niceties of sitting in the front. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">For long flights, using reward miles for the preferred class is a better deal most of the time than paying cash for an upgrade. The reason is that the actual value of a business or first class is not the market price of the seat; hence miles can stretch further. The best frequent flyer program in Europe is British Airways Executive Club. </p>


                            <h3>Do not be shy about contacting customer service</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">You won't get to know how much a flight might cost in miles if you book through a third-party website like Expedia and many more. You need to make reservations through the airline's website. You will get a clear option to see how much the flight will cost in dollars or miles. Finding the best flight to understand the conversion rates can be confusing and time-consuming. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">You can always contact the airline's reservation desk for help and assistance. You might need to pay a fee to have the agent book the flight over the phone, but it is worth spending. You will get the most out of your miles with the correct reservation. Hence do not be shy and overthink about contacting customer service. </p>


                            <h3>Reaping the benefits of using integrated analytics</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">The fierce competition and the pricing among the airlines have started attracting more and more passengers. This is a strategy by the airlines to increase the number of travellers. Data analytics has helped airlines to gain insight into customers' behavior and preferences by looking at their travel history and spending patterns. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">By applying predictive analysis, airlines could predict customers' needs for the future by analyzing when they are planning for their next trip. Analytics got more integrated with customer days. Airlines partnered with other airlines, hotels, and credit card companies to offer catalogs and services based on customer behavior. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Airlines are focusing more on frequent flyer programs to increase revenue and add value to the customer's overall experience by using the data that has been received from different sources and by giving an insight into the customers' future needs. IGT's analytics services provide significant business insight by integrating multiple data sources using a proven methodology, established frameworks, automated tools and many more for the travel industry. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">These were tips on getting the most benefits of frequent flyer programs. Some ways to earn and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/how-to-get-the-most-benefits-from-frequent-flyer-programs.aspx">advantage of frequent flyer programs </a>are by booking with airlines, hotels, and rental car partners, joining airlines dining rewards programs, gaining elite status, and many more. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">The best frequent flyer program for 2022 is the Mileage Plan from Alaska Airlines. Hence it is not at all challenging to use rewards credit cards that offer miles. Try to get a credit card that best fits your lifestyle, and charge carefully on things that will boost your miles while keeping your debt to zero. </p>
