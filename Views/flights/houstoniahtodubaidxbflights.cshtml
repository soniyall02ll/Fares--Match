            <p>Dubai is one of the largest and most important cities in the United Arab Emirates and currently ranks as the most populated city of its most populated emirate, the Emirate of Dubai. Dubai is known to people around the world due to the large share of expatriates in its population, who make up nearly ninety per cent of all people living in the city.</p>
            <p>Dubai has become one of the most popular locations in the world for immigrants seeking work due to its status as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. While the city initially depended greatly on contributions made by the revenue earned from its oil reserves, the economy has diversified greatly allowing the town to expand further.</p>
            <p>The city has been considered a hub for tourism and luxury. Likewise, it invests a great deal in these sectors to maintain the appeal of a trip to the city. As such, the city has gained international recognition for its world-class luxury hotels and resorts which are a far cry from the fishing village it was established as in the eighteenth century.</p>
            <h2>Houston – The Origin</h2>
            <p>Houston is one of the most important cities of the United States of America amplified by its position as the most populated city of the state of Texas which is located in the southern part of the country. Houston is located in the southeastern part of the state near the Gulf of Mexico and Galveston Bay.</p>
            <p>Houston is also considered one of the highest populated metropolitan areas of its continent and therefore <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flight-tickets-booking.aspx"><b>Flight ticket bookings</b></a> to the city becomes exceedingly difficult due to the great demand for them. Houston is one of the top ten largest cities in its country with the unique distinction of not having its area consolidated under a borough, parish or county.</p>
            <p>Houston is named after the famed general Sam Houston who fought and won the independence of the state from Mexican rule and also served as the state’s capital for a while. Soon after, the city came to develop independently as a regional trading centre and a transportation hub after the establishment and popularisation of railroad and road transportation.</p>
