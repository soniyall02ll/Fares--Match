            <h3 class="text-justify"> Day 1: Visiting Amusement Parks </h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> Take in the enchantment of Orlando's well-known theme parks to begin your three-day visit. Start your adventure by going to Walt Disney World Resort, where you may explore the famous Magic Kingdom, go on exhilarating rides in Disney's Animal Kingdom or Hollywood Studios, or visit Epcot to enjoy a glimpse of the future. </p>
            <h3 class="text-justify">Day 2: Orlando Resort Universal and More </h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> On the second day of your trip, go to Universal Orlando Resort. Visit Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Florida to explore the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Savour delicious snacks, stroll around Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, and ride exhilarating rides. For a distinctive and instructive afternoon excursion, consider going to some other attractions, such as SeaWorld Orlando or the Kennedy Space Center. </p>
            <h3 class="text-justify">Day 3: Shopping and Outdoor Activities </h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> On your last day, escape the theme parks and discover Orlando's scenic surroundings and retail options. Visit Lake Eola Park in downtown Orlando first, where you may rent a paddleboat in the shape of a swan or take a stroll. After that, indulge in some shopping therapy at the Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets or the Mall at Millenia. Consider taking an airboat excursion in the neighboring Everglades. </p>

            <h2>The ideal time to visit Orlando from Denver </h2>
            <p class="text-justify"> Orlando is most enjoyable from March through May. It's the best time of year to visit, with temperatures often in the upper 50s to high 80s and reasonable transport and accommodation costs (not including holidays and school breaks). You might get greater bargains on travel and lodging by avoiding busy periods like big holidays and school breaks. Weekdays without school breaks can be preferable for a more laid-back atmosphere. </p>
