            <p class="text-justify">Well known for its natural beauty, Missoula attracts many travelers hoping for a getaway to nature. The scenic city was historically the home of the Salish, Kootenai, Pend d’Oreille, Blackfeet, and Shoshone people. The city derives its name from the Missoula Mills, which supplies those traveling along Mullan Road. Fort Missoula, built in 1877, consolidated the hold of white settlers. The city became dependent on its timber industry. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">This industry had given way to other, more sustainable options in the ninth decade of the twentieth century. By the turn of the century and the following decade, Missoula emerged as a center of education and research with the rising prominence of the University of Montana and the Missoula County Public Schools. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">If you are a nature lover, visit the confluence of the Clark Fork River with the Blackfoot River and the Bitterroot River.
