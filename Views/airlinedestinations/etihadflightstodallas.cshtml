                    <p class="text-justify">Dallas is one of the busiest and most highly populated cities in the United States of America. It is also one of the most important cities in Texas and a well-known metropolis in the Dallas Fort Worth Region. Once established here, the city owes much of its development to the transportation industry. The railroads built in Dallas provided easy access to raw materials such as oil, cattle, and cotton from North and South Texas. Later, the development of interstate highways, which ran through the city and connected it to many other American cities, also helped cement its status as an essential city of America. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Another mode of transport that greatly aided Dallas in its growth was its inland port. Dallas is a leading centre of industry and finance due to its multiple links to significant export and import centres.
