                <p class="text-justify">Reno, Nevada, is an excellent destination if you've ever sought to enjoy some time in a place where the real Old West vibe is still present. Reno has never truly achieved international recognition, being largely disregarded in favor of its counterpart in southern Nevada, Sin City. To get a true picture of the "Biggest Little City In The World," ask any resident who lives close to the state capital; they will only be able to speak highly of it. There are rarely any clouds in the sky because there are more than 300 days of sunshine and less than ten inches of annual precipitation. You'll thus always have something to do, whether your plans involve hiking up Mount Rose, skiing at Lake Tahoe in the winter, or riding a fifty-mile bike ride in the summer. Suppose you need more than that for you. In that case, Reno also has a lot of interesting museums, delicious restaurants, a fascinating history in railroads and mining, a vibrant nightlife, casinos, and theatres. <b>Book flights to Lake Tahoe</b> now and grab the best deals on FaresMatch. </p>
