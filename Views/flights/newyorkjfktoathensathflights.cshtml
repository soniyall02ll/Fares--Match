                <li><b>Plaka District:</b> The charming Plaka District is a combination of all the aforementioned elements, as well as irregularly shaped alleys, traditional restaurants, and souvenir stores.</li>
                <li><b>Temple of Olympian Zeus:</b> This enormous structure built in devotion to the head god contained the statue of Zeus. Even what is left of the columns suggests that the structure was impressively large.</li>
            </ul>
