While booking, you can also make a perfect plan for a trip to Denver through our website. Here's a two-day plan of how to explore Denver:  </p>


            <b>Day 1</b>
            <p> Kickstart your day with breakfast at HashTAG. After your breakfast, take a guided tour of the Colorado State Capitol. Next, enjoy lunch at the Denver Central Market. Head to the Denver Botanical Gardens and enjoy a walk in the beautiful garden. End your first day with a delicious dinner at Satta Restaurant.  </p>


            <b>Day 2</b>
            <p> Start your morning savoring the local biscuits and coffee at Denver Biscuit Company. Next, spend an hour at the Clyfford Still Museum. Head next door to the famous Denver Art Museum. Explore the variety of art and stunning exhibitions. Savour a delicious lunch in the Denver Milk Market and grab a drink at 54Thirty, the highest rooftop bar in Denver. If you want to add one more day to your trip, then you should visit Rocky Mountain National Park.  </p>

            <h2>When would be the perfect time to visit Denver?</h2>
            <p> The summer(June to August) is the ideal season to visit Denver, not only because of the increased number of attractions in the city but also because it's easier to travel up to the mountains. Many visitors to Denver truly hope to spend some time in the mountains, even if it's just in the foothills. One benefit of summertime dry road travel is an easier route into the Rocky Mountains.  </p>

            <p> Some resorts provide ski slopes if you travel during the cooler months(November to March), and autumn trekking to view lakes or waterfalls is a fun family activity for hikers of all skill levels. Fall is the least packed season to book a cheap <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>flight ticket</b></a> and visit Denver because some sites stop in early September following Labor Day, and others have shortened hours.  </p>
