                <h3>Customs &amp; Entry Requirements in United Flights</h3>
                <p>When travelling internationally, you must go through customs. For domestic travel or trips within the EU, customs checks are typically not required. However, you will still need to pass through security checks, where your ID and documents will likely be verified. It's a good idea to have these documents readily accessible throughout your journey.</p>
                <p>Entry requirements vary by country, so it’s essential to research the specific requirements for your destination. Some countries may require a visa, proof of insurance, or even bank statements. Your passport must be valid for the entire duration of your stay, with some countries demanding at least six months of validity beyond your arrival date. Requirements can differ based on factors like the length of your stay, the purpose of your travel, and the regulations set by the destination country.</p>
                <p>For the most accurate information, we recommend checking the official government websites of your destination.</p>
                <p><b>Connecting Flights</b></p>
                <p>Connecting flights involves taking multiple flights to reach your destination, which can lead to a longer travel time, especially when direct flights are unavailable.</p>
                <p>If your connecting flight is booked on the same ticket, your baggage will usually be checked through to your destination. However, due to potential flight delays, busy airports, and tight layovers, it's possible for you to make your flight while your baggage does not. Therefore, many travellers are opting to travel light and ship their luggage ahead of time.</p>
                <p>Be aware that many low-cost airlines do not offer connecting flights, meaning you will need to manage your onward connections independently and collect your baggage after each flight.</p>
