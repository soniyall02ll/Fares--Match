            <h2>When to travel?</h2>
            <p> The recommended periods for <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>booking flights</b></a> to Orlando are from March to May and September to November. Such months do not have unfavorable weather conditions and are not overcrowded, so common activities include visiting theme parks and other recreational centers. </p>
            <p> For cheap flights to New Orleans, the best time to travel is between February and May, which includes the colorful carnival spirit of Mardi Gras and colorful spring festivals. October and November also have comfortable temperatures and fewer visitors than other months. </p>
