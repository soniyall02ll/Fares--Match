For passengers seeking a more efficient and pleasant journey—both at the airport and on board—the Air Canada business class experience is well worth the price and is a fitting reflection of the airline's standing as the most well-known in Canada.

On the A220-300, Air Canada also has business class seats, but you won't get the privacy of a lie-flat bed or pod.</p>

            <h2>All the benefits of Air Canada Business class </h2>

            <p><b>Check-in </b></p>

            <p><b>Baggage </b></p>
