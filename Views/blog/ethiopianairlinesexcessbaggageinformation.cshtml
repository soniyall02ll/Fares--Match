                <p class="text-justify">Ethiopian Airlines has been quite a famous name in the aviation industry for quite some time now, especially in Africa. In Africa, Ethiopian Airlines is considered one of the best, if not the very best, airlines to opt for air travel due to its hospitality, swift traveling experience, and very less hassle, precisely regarding the baggage situation. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Air travel sometimes involves trouble regarding the baggage and luggage situation, and Ethiopian airlines help passengers properly regulate baggage. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Although baggage, on the whole, might seem like a small topic to discuss, keeping in mind a whole airline, it is important to every individual traveler. <b>Ethiopian airline’s baggage tracking </b>is quite an advantageous factor, making it one of the best choices for aviation. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Let us have a look at some of how the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/ethiopian-airlines.aspx">Ethiopian airlines rules and regulations</a> frame the baggage related norms and how smoothly the whole baggage situation is carried out: </p>

                <h2>Allowance of Free Baggage</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The permissible weight for single baggage in Ethiopian airlines is thirty-two kilograms. The sum total of all the three dimensions of the baggage should not be more than 158 centimeters in length, that is, the sum of the baggage's length, breadth, and height. </li>

                    <li>Ethiopian airlines are very strict about the prospect of some baggage that can be damaging or disrupt the flow of other baggage in the conveyor belt. Generally, this baggage is refused to be considered for travel unless properly bound and packed with appropriate measures. </li>

                    <li>According to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/ethiopian-airlines-excess-baggage-information.aspx">Ethiopian airline's baggage allowance for international flights</a>, passengers are advised to carry properly packed baggage so that the things inside the baggage do not get damaged or misplaced. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">It is due to this reason that paper or any other kind of makeshift bags, thin cardboard boxes, and other such fragile material baggage are strictly prohibited for air travel on Ethiopian airlines. Unless one is issued something called Limited Release Tags, which allows passengers to carry such fragile baggage, the responsibility stays with the passenger. The airline is in no way to blame for any damage. </p>


                <h3>Carry-on Baggage</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Carry-on baggage refers to the extra hand baggage, which must not be more than 5 kilograms in weight, and should be compact (Compact here means that the baggage should not disrupt other people while traveling). This baggage can stay back with the holder while traveling and is permitted for usage. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Since if a certain item does not meet the criteria, <b>Ethiopian airlines extra baggage</b> charges are levied on the item, let us look at some of the items that can pass off as carry-on baggage: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Outfits and accessories to outfits</b>
                        Overcoats, wraps, blankets, handbags, purses, pocketbooks, and other things are considered carry-on baggage unless and until they are being used to transport something else, in which case, they would be considered separate baggage.
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <b>Infant requirements</b>
                        food for the infant to consume during the flight, toys for the infant, and carrying baskets for infants.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Electronic appliances</b>
                        Laptops, tablets, a pair of binoculars, and a small handheld camera include some of the electronic appliances allowed as carry-on baggage on a flight.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">Passengers must be made aware of the restrictions and regulations on what can be considered carry-on and what cannot be. Constant communication and support from the airline staff ensure no drawback in carrying such luggage. </p>


                <h4>Excess Baggage</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Talking about excess baggage, Ethiopian airlines has a sound policy regarding it. Excess baggage normally includes sporting equipment, quite big equipment for carry-on baggage, and pets. Let us have a better look into excess baggage and policies relevant to it in the Ethiopian airlines: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sporting equipment</b>
                        To be considered as sporting equipment, the extra baggage must be accompanied by checked-in baggage, making the sporting equipment the second baggage. The sporting equipment falls under the category of baggage itself and has almost the same criteria.
                    </li>

                    <p class="text-justify">It cannot be more than thirty-two kilograms in weight, and after adding all of its dimensions, the result should not be more than 158 centimeters 62 inches. In any other area where the matter of equipment requires some kind of jurisdiction, the Ethiopian airlines' word will be final. </p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Electronic goods</b>
                        Sometimes, electronic goods need to be moved from one place to another. This is when the excess baggage feature of Ethiopian airlines comes in very handy. Especially in Africa, since electronic goods are not manufactured everywhere, they need to be transported from one place to another. The charges for moving these goods from one place to another differ depending on departure and arrival place.
                    </li>

                    <p class="text-justify">These electronic goods include TVs, laptops, mobile phones, refrigerators, and other such items. For more information about the difference in costs of transportation of these goods, one can refer to the Ethiopian airline's website. </p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Pets</b>
                        Pets are probably the most requested and transported forms of excess baggage in the aviation industry and service animals. Since they need to be taken special care of and have certain needs, the charges are on the higher side. But Ethiopian airlines ensure a splendid guarantee while flying pets and service animals. To get a pet or service animal registered as excess baggage, one has to contact the airlines and respective authorities before the flight.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">Service animals are those who are required by visually or hearing-impaired people, for their support and help. So, those people need them for their day-to-day lives and also for every other work. Ethiopian airlines make it a priority to help these people and the animals so that their life can go on smoothly. </p>


                <p class="text-justify">These were some of the tidbits of information regarding baggage and excess baggage. If one is truly inquisitive and curious about the ongoing baggage control and regulation in the Ethiopian airlines, one can easily learn more about the process from the official website of Ethiopian Airlines, which is open 24 hours,7 days a week. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">One can also view the baggage policy of Ethiopian airlines by searching it on the Internet. Ethiopian airlines have done a wonderful job of maintaining strong baggage security and transportation policy. </p>
