            <h2>The best way to explore Houston in cheap</h2>

            <p>Do you want to save money and enjoy your trip more? Then book your <b>Las Vegas to Houston flights</b> through <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>Faresmatch</b></a> and grab the ongoing deal. To explore Houston, the best way you can plan your trip is through the three-day Houston guide offered on our website. Here's the three-day tour plan of Houston: </p>


            <b>Day 1</b>
            <p>Explore the iconic attractions and foods of Houston on the first day. Take a guided tour and explore Buffalo Bayou, Market Square, Hermann Park, the Museum district, the Minute Maid Park, and the downtown. After your lunch, visit the Space Centre Houston. End your day with Tex-Mex food in Houston. </p>


            <b>Day 2</b>
            <p>Explore the cultural side of the city on your second day. Start your day in the Houston Museum District, which is packed with 19 museums. Take a visit to the Museum of Natural Science, Museum of Fine Arts,   children's museum, and more. In the evening, visit the historic San Jacinto Monument and Battleship Texas. End your day with a food tour in the downtown. </p>


            <b>Day 3</b>
            <p>After exploring all the popular landmarks spend your third day leisurely by visiting the Galveston island. Soak up the sun on the beach or explore the Victorian homes and shops. Enjoy the fresh seafood at one of the Galveston restaurants. </p>

            <h2>Best time to plan your trip to Houston</h2>

            <p>Houston is most enjoyable in February through April or September through November. Houston has nice weather and reasonably priced hotel accommodations almost all year round because of its closeness to the Gulf of Mexico. However, spring and fall bring lovely temperatures and a wide range of festivals. Also, because of the exceptional weather at this time, a lot of festivities are planned for people to enjoy. </p>

            <p>Since Houstonians move when the temperature rises, you might be able to find a better deal in the summer, but you'll have to live with the intense heat and muggy humidity. Although it rarely snows in Houston, the city does have mild winters. Book direct flights from Houston to Las Vegas and explore Houston during this time. </p>
