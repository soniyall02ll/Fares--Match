            <h2>Norfolk: History and Culture</h2>
            <p>Norfolk, Virginia, is perhaps the most enthralling portal for travellers coming via Breeze Airways. Nestled in its path by the Chesapeake Bay, this glittering city has a wonderful history, culture, and modernity that makes it a unique must-visit. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The city's historic maritime past is well represented by the USS Wisconsin and the Nauticus Maritime Museum, which afford tourists the rare opportunity to view a part of Norfolk's importance in American naval tradition. </li>
                <li>Wander about the city's cobbled streets, discover a thriving arts scene, and behold the Chrysler Museum of Art leading the way with its impressive collection of works from many centuries and cultures.</li>
                <li>Norfolk's history runs through its neighbourhoods, from that of the Freemason District, where Victorian architecture meets waterfront views, to the city itself. </li>
                <li>Towns fighting in both of America's great wars—the Revolutionary and Civilian—have also witnessed more than their share of history in the era of steam and shipping. </li>
                <li>History is open and alive: from a beautiful old church tour to handmade ornaments by local artisans, one can enjoy both the past and the present.</li>
