                    <p>Chicago is a beautifully scenic city located on the banks of the Michigan Lake in the United States of America. While it had once been the home of the indigenous Potawatomi people, in the mid-eighteenth century, the first permanent European settler, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, arrived & settled in the area & started the first nonindigenous settlement in the region. This settlement slowly developed into the city travellers know today. </p>
