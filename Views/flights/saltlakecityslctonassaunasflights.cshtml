            <p class="text-justify">Nassau is one of the busiest and most important cities in the Bahamas. As the capital of the archipelago nation, it is the centre of administration and law in the country. It is, additionally, a leading centre of commerce, media and education in the country. With most of the population of the country living in the city, Nassau is considered the heart of the country. The town had been a point of conflict between the Spanish and the British for a while, and the modern settlement came into existence in the seventeenth century after the Spanish had conducted a successful raid on the previous British settlement in that area known as Charles Town. Control of the city continued to be disputed, and this provided an opportunity for pirates. Soon, the area became known as a stronghold of pirates who frequently used it as a harbour and defence point for their ships. The natural assets of the island, such as abundant food and good waterways, solidified its status. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">In the eighteenth century, piracy was significantly reduced due to the renewed efforts of the British Empire. During the American War of Independence, the situation of the island greatly improved due to the improvement in funds available. The city continued to develop with the presence of loyalists who supported the British cause during the war and who resettled on these lands after being forced to leave the newly independent United States of America.
