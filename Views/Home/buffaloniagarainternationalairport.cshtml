            <h3>How does air traffic around Buffalo affect flights at the airport?</h3>
            <p>
                Due to its proximity to major airports such as Toronto Pearson International Airport and Billy Bishop
                Toronto City Airport, Buffalo's airspace experiences high flight traffic. While most of these
                flights are outbound or inbound to various destinations, they typically operate at altitudes above
                6,500 feet, which ensures that they do not interfere with the air traffic at Buffalo Niagara
                International Airport.
