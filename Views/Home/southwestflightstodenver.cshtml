            <p>Denver is a city in America named to honour the nineteenth-century politician James Denver. Due to its location at the bottom of the Rocky Mountains, Denver is surrounded by foothills and on the banks of the meeting spot of two important rivers: the Cherry Creek and the South Platte Rivers. </p>
            <p>The Cheyenne and Arapaho people, who had been indigenous to this area for centuries, settled in it. Only during the Klondike Gold Rush in the nineteenth century was the area turned into the township we know today due to its increased importance. It has since become a leading city in the nation it belongs to. The city is well known as a prime centre of art and culture and has been carefully preserved.</p>
            <p>It is easy to find <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-denver.aspx"><b>cheap flights to Denver</b></a> if travellers follow the following simple steps.
