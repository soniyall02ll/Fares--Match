                            <p class="text-justify">Visiting romantic getaway spots is one of the finest ways to keep the spark alive in a relationship, whether you've just started dating or have been married for years. That's especially true these days when you've probably been spending a lot of time at home with your partner for quite a long time. There’s nothing like a couples vacation to reset and recall why you fell in love in the first place. Following are the 17 best getaway spots for couples to make a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/weekend-getaway-deals.aspx">flight booking for romantic weekend in the USA</a>:</p>


                            <h2 class="text-justify">Sonoma, California</h2>

                            <p class="text-justify">Sonoma is a beautiful place to visit. This place has it all: farms, vineyards, and a general sense of well-being. You should book a cedar bath for two at Osmosis day spa after hopping between vineyards and indulging in some local juice and fun (don't miss the pool at Francis Ford Coppola or the thriving acres of spring tulips at Ferrari-Carano). </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Glacier National Park, Montana</h2>

                            <p class="text-justify">This park warrants one of the must-visit getaway spots on your bucket list, with mountain lakes surrounded by rugged peaks, 600-foot waterfalls, and glaciers. Hike, horseback ride, or take a boat ride to see if you can spot a grizzly bear or mountain goat, then warm yourself next to a fire or a big supper. </p>


                            <h2 class="text-justify">Kauai, Hawaii</h2>

                            <p class="text-justify">If craggy cliffs and sunny sand, emerald hills, and epic hikes are your ideas of paradise, plan a trip to Kauai with your better half. Take a helicopter trip past the Jurassic Park waterfall, kayak Hawaii's only navigable river, or wander the untamed Na Pali Coast on the "Garden Isle," a green utopia. </p>


                            <h2 class="text-justify">Woodstock, Vermont</h2>

                            <p class="text-justify">With its white-steepled churches and snug cabins complete with a fireplace, Woodstock offers the ideal lovely New England experience, replete with sipping red wine, terrific skiing, and lots of cuddling with the one you love.

                                New York romance is all about connecting with your lover amid the craziness, thanks to the city's constant hustle. Rent a rowboat in Central Park or, throw caution to the wind and visit the Museum of Sex or take the tram to Roosevelt Island for panoramic views of the city. So many amazing things to experience in one place. Isn't it?
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Block Island, Rhode</h2>

                            <p class="text-justify">The Narragansett tribe named this tiny isle "Island of the Little God," and it is a world away from the mainland, 12 miles off the coast of Rhode Island. Rent a bike or moped, order a sandwich from Three Sisters, then head out to your favorite beach or scenic trail with your spouse. </p>


                            <h2 class="text-justify">Amelia Island, Florida</h2>
