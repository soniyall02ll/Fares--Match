                    <h2>Best Time to Visit Cambodia </h2>
                    <p>The best time to visit Cambodia is the dry season which extends from November to March. The five months of the year forming this season are comparatively warmer and more comfortable than the wet spells which are known to last in the city. Of these, November finds the city slightly less crowded than the rest of this peak season allowing travellers to get accommodation and flights at more affordable rates. </p>
