                    <p>
                        Maui is one of the most important islands in the Hawaiian archipelago. The city’s economy
                        depends greatly on its tourism centre, as many tourists travel to the island each year. The
                        city is famous for its tropical beaches and variety of wildlife.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some popular points of interest include the Hana Highway, which leads to Hana. The highway is
                        a long, winding road that curves around beaches, waterfalls, and mountains, providing an
                        opportunity to glimpse some of the most beautiful places on the island. Hana is a quaint and
                        simple town that houses the historic Pi’ilani Heiau, one of the largest Hawaiian temples and
                        the most famous example of a heiau. Other spots of interest include the currently dormant
                        Haleakalā volcano, which rises to an impressive height of 3,055 metres.
                    </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Around this sleeping volcano is the lush Haleakalā National Park. The park is home to many endangered
                species of fauna endemic to Hawaii, including Hawaiian honeycreepers, Maui Alauahio, Akohekohe, and
                Kiwikiu, as well as unique and rare species of fauna such as Haleakalā silversword and Haleakalā
                schiedam.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other side of the island lies another set of volcanic mountains- Mauna Kahalāwāi. Close to it
                is the ‘Īao Valley, which is a popular spot for urban tourists seeking respite with its greenery.
                Maui is also well known for the wide range of water sports offered here, including swimming and
                surfing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best way to get cheap flights to Maui from D.C. is to get tickets in advance and opt for
                low-price periods. Travellers are advised to maintain flexibility in their travel schedule to make
                allowances for any sudden hike in price. This necessary precaution ensures that costly flights can
                be avoided in favour of more budget-friendly options.
