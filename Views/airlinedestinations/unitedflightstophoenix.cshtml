                <p class="text-justify">Phoenix is considered among America’s most important and most highly populated cities. The town, located in Arizona, is part of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area and helms the Valley of the Sun, one of its most important areas. The city covers a vast area and is known all over the country for its colossal size and harsh temperature. The town, located in the Salt River Valley at the edge of the Sonoran Desert, experiences high temperatures all year round. This does not deter travellers from visiting this leading centre of art and culture to admire this unique city. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">While the city had once been the home of multiple Indigenous American communities, such as the Hohokaj and later the Akimel O’odham, the Tohono O’odham, and the Maricopa people, it saw its first European settlers only after this area was ceded to the United States of America by Mexico as a part of the Mexican- American War which had taken place in the middle of the nineteenth century. Until then, the area had been cultivated sporadically, with inhabitants depending on the rains for agriculture. The canal system, which brought water to the city on a far more regular basis, led to its large-scale development and slowly shaped the city we know today. </p>
