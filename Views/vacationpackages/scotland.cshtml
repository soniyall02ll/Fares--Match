                    <h2>Climate and Best Period</h2>
                    <p>Scotland is obviously worth visiting the whole year; the final answer for the best times depends on the choice of experience. Spring (April-June) and Autumn (September-October) provide mild weather with fewer tourists, so they are best for sightseeing. Summer, on the other hand, provides far longer daylight times with lots of lively festivals, whereas winter turns magical in the Highlands with snow covering the peaks.</p>
