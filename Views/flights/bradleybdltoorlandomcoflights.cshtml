            <h3>When to plan your visit to Orlando?</h3>

            <p>It is recommended that anyone planning a trip to Orlando should do it from late March to May or from late September to early November. These seasons are characterized by good weather, moderate traffic, and relatively cheaper hotel tariffs than during the 'peak' summer season. Spring has flowers and festivals, whereas autumn has Halloween and trick-or-treat in chief theme parks. Staying away from the holiday rush, holidaymakers are relatively few, especially during Christmas and summer vacations and this makes it easy to visit attractions without queuing for many hours. Always look for special events and weather forecasts before traveling.</p>
