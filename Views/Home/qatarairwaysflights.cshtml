            <h3>Qatar Airways Cabin Class</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Economy Class : </b>Qatar Airways has a variety of seating options for both short- and long-haul flights, similar to many other airlines. However, economy class is a comparable option on most of its aircraft. In economy class, the typical seat width ranges from 17.5 to 18.5 inches (the maximum on the Airbus A380), while on all aircraft, the regular seat pitch is 31 inches. However, unlike other carriers, Qatar Airways equips its Airbus narrowbodies with seatback screens.</li>
                <li><b>Business Class : </b>On all of its itineraries and with every aircraft, Qatar Airways provides a business-class experience. The newest model in its fleet, the modified Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, is the only aircraft that provides the new Business Class Suite. Exclusive check-in, complimentary seat selection, lounge accessibility, lie-flat seats, customized hot and cold meals delivered at convenient times, free premium drinks, an amenity kit, entertainment onboard, and noise-reducing headphones are all included in <b>Qatar Airlines' business class</b> offerings.</li>
                <li><b>First class : </b>First class is only available on Qatar Airways' Airbus A380. While Qatar offers "first class" tickets across the Middle East, it should be noted that they are simply standard A320 business class seats, with the added benefit of access to the well-liked Al Safwa First Class Lounge in Doha. First-class chairs come with an entertainment system and massage features. Two 26-inch TV displays and a 90-inch (230 cm) seat can be made into a completely flat bed in the cabin.</li>
