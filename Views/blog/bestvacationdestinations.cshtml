                <p>Beaches are one of the most therapeutic natural scenery the world has gifted us. As you would sit by the shore of your favorite beach as the sun melts, and forms a golden glaze over the vast expanse of waters you would feel as if everything weighing down on you is melting away. The waves some a little more unruly than the others clash on the shores as your feet feel the water touch, and retreat to make you realize that everything after a point would return to its rightful place. This is the ideal <b>beach vacation</b>.</p>
