            <h2>When to book flights from Spokane to Seattle? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">What you plan to do in Seattle will determine the best time. Sunny skies are ideal for exploring the parks and gardens that give the Emerald City its name and for taking in the breathtaking vistas from the Space Needle. Still, they also bring large crowds of tourists with them. Bring an umbrella if you'd rather travel during the off-peak months to avoid the crowds and pay less for lodging. All four seasons offer reasons to visit: trekking in the summer, leaf-picking in the fall, snow activities in the winter, and strolling through the downtown area in the spring. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The greatest time to experience warm weather is from late spring to early summer, when the breathtaking natural wonders of the Pacific Northwest may be fully appreciated. The city's peak season is summer when hotel costs increase and availability decreases. Still, the bitterly cold winter months might turn off even the most ardent tourists. But early autumn is a great time to visit because the summer heat lasts until the crowds thin out, meaning plenty of hotel rooms are available at cheaper prices. While the weather is milder and lodging costs are lower in the spring, you may expect some rain and chilly breezes.</p>
