            <h3>1. Cultural activities</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Croatia seems to be the ideal spot to learn about fascinating history by visiting cities, villages, or small villages. Walking Dubrovnik's walls, for instance, is an exhilarating introduction to this old city. That's a short but breathtaking gallop across battlements overlooking an Adriatic. The amphitheater in Pula, Imperial Rome's finest gift to the eastern Adriatic, is still used for summer concerts. The Diocletian Mansion, the former Roman emperor's pied-à-Terre at Split, remains so at the center of the current city. Many more of Croatia's smaller cities are rich in historical significance.

            <h3>2. Diving</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Croatia became one of the greatest popular scuba-diving destinations inside the Mediterranean in recent years, thanks to the Adriatic's crystal-clear waters and its diverse marine life. Along the Adriatic coast, a growing number of diving centers offer instruction, guided adventures, and equipment rental. The Kornati islands in central Dalmatia as well as the island of Mljet near Dubrovnik were two of the most interesting diving destinations. There are various flights available with great offers and discounts. One can avail of those. </p>
            <h3>3. Beach-life</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">There are beaches and there is diving, and Croatia has some of Europe's greatest. The opulent Kraljiina plaa (Queen's Beach) near Zadar has just a couple of beach bars and not much, save for mesmerizing views of such Velebit mountains across the lake and a beautiful stretch of sand. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The nicest beach on Hvar is silky sandy Grebie, whereas the deserted islet of Proizd, nearby Vela Luka on picturesque Korula Island, offers a sublimely quiet, serene shoreline of white sand with sloping rocks. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Croatia has a strong music culture, which is best appreciated during the summer festive periods, when almost every genre of music is provided for, including indie rock at InMusic, cutting-edge club music at Tisno, or dub-to-dubstep extravaganzas there at Punta Christo fortress nearby Pula. The Pula Film Festival, featuring premieres of each year's crop of local feature films, takes place in late July just at Pula Amphitheater. </p>
            <h3>4. Shopping</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">Zagreb seems to be the greatest place to shop in Croatia, with a variety of retail experiences not seen along the Adriatic coast, such as regular fleas or collectors' marketplaces. Several of the best gifts to carry back from Croatia involve meals and drinks, including world-class wines and herb-flavored rakija, which often include plant fragments in the bottle. Soaps prepared from olive oil and scented with local herbs, as well as bundles of lavender harvested just on the island of Hvar, also are wonderful buys.
