With the number of bike trails crisscrossing the city and the earth-friendly organic cafes and farm-to-table restaurants, it is an example for many cities to follow.</p>

            <h2>Natural Adventures in and out of Town</h2>
            <p>For true nature lovers, Portland is heaven. The hiking trails of the Forest Park, which is one of the largest urban forests in the U.S., waterfalls from the Columbia River Gorge nearby and several other places ensure the city is designed in such a way that you are never far from an escape outdoors without a hike.</p>
            <p>Booking <b>Delta flights from Ontario to Portland</b> through FaresMatch gets you all set for these renewing experiences.</p>

            <h3>Portland’s Iconic Food Cart Culture</h3>
            <p>Portland is most of the time famous for its wide range of food– from vegan doughnuts to wild game. The carts are the heartbeat of that culinary spirit, and entire "pods" of carts are dedicated to international flavours.</p>

            <h3>Travelling Promises an Experience of Charm and Relaxation</h3>
            <p>Nestled within this Inland Empire, Ontario finds itself between the small-town warmth of a community with a pulse – the urban. From the historic Euclid Avenue, which is dotted with little elegant boutiques, to the Ontario Museum of History and Art's immersive experience, this city invites its fair share of exploration.</p>
