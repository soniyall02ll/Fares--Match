            <p>Searching for the most affordable business class tickets on Emirates? You only need to look at Faresmatch. Our affordable prices and special offers will enable you to book the greatest luxury experience in <b>Emirates business class</b> . One of the greatest business classes available is the business class offered by Emirates. Excellent eating and beverage selections, excellent service, comfy seats, and even a private bar are all features of the A380. We wouldn't expect anything less from Emirates because it's a fantastic airline. </p>
            <p>Emirates offers business class on most international flights using A380 and 777 aircraft. Chauffeur service is a pleasant and practical addition, and lounges or lounge partners are provided in many major international airports. The atmosphere aboard is opulent, and the service is first-rate. While business seats on the 777 are near to other people and on the A380 are staggered in one, the first class provides large seats with closing doors if total seclusion is what you're looking for.</p>

            <h2>Business class seats on Emirates</h2>

            <h5>777</h5>
            <p>Not every passenger has direct aisle access due to the 2-3-2 seat arrangement. They have wood paneling, luxurious cream leather, and a width of 20.5 inches with a pitch of 60 inches. Every seat has a headphone jack, USB port, and outlet. In addition to soft slippers, amenity kits also include a full-size deodorant, over-ear headphones, a zip-up amenity bag, Bvlgari lotion, lip balm, cologne, shaving cream, and razor. </p>

            <h5>A380</h5>
            <p>The A380's business class Emirates seats are unquestionably better than the 777's. Because of the 1-2-1 seat arrangement, each person gets greater privacy and access to the aisle. They are significantly smaller at 18.5 inches with wood paneling and cream leather, the same as the 777.</p>

            <h2>Airport facilities of Emirates Business class </h2>

            <h6>Check-in for Emirates business class  </h6>
            <p>If business class is available on an Emirates aircraft, there will be a dedicated check-in station for business travelers. Upon arrival, the bags with priority tags will be the first to come off the luggage carousel. Additionally, you will receive a fast-track pass (pre-check in the US) and, if you are entering the UAE, a fast-track pass for immigration. </p>
            <h6>Allowance for bags  </h6>
            <p>Tickets purchased in business class allow for two checked bags totaling no more than 70 pounds each. </p>
            <h6>Lounge services  </h6>
            <p>In 70 cities, including Dubai, Emirates provides free chauffeur pick-up and drop-off services for business class guests. Lounges such as the Moët and Chandon Champagne Lounge in Dubai are open around the clock and give a range of services. Although some are closed because of the epidemic, Emirates also runs lounges in several US, Australian, and European locations.</p>
