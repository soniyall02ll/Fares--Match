            <h2>When to Plan a trip from Toronto to Cancun? </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Sun-seekers from the United States head south to Cancún, which offers immaculate white-sand beaches, dazzling ocean waters, and a vibrant metropolitan atmosphere. Winter is an alluring season to visit some of the nation's best beaches because of the warm weather. Still, it's also the busiest and most costly on the Caribbean coast, with visitors trading in their hot chocolate for margaritas and snow for sand. December through April, when the resort is busiest, is the ideal time to visit Cancún. </p>
