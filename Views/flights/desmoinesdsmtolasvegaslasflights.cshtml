Here's a three-day travel plan for Las Vegas: </p>


            <p><b>Day 1</b></p>
            <p>Start your day with a breakfast at the Cosmopolitan. Get on a big bus tour, which will take you to every notable location. Stop at the Caesar's Palace and The Luxor. Visit the High Roller in the afternoon. Next, visit the Grand Canal Shoppes inside Venetian, which transport you to Venice Street in Italy. After that, visit the Bellagio Conservatory. Enjoy your dinner and enjoy the nightlife in front of the stunning Bellagio Fountains.</p>


            <p><b>Day 2</b></p>
            <p>Explore the Fremont street on your second day. Downtown Las Vegas is the most authentic part of the city. Enjoy the 360 views of the city from the Skypod observation deck. Visit the shopping oasis at the Fashion Show mall and enjoy some shopping if you want. Next, enjoy your dinner at the Chandelier Bar and head to Cirque du Soleil to enjoy a show or you can also visit Area15.</p>


            <p><b>Day 3</b></p>
            <p>It's time for some adventure on your third day. Hike or climb the iconic Grand Canyon and soak in the views from above. After a full day of adventure savor some yummy dinner at the Las Vegas Strip enjoying the views of the Bellagio fountains.</p>

            <h2>When to plan a visit to Las Vegas</h2>

            <p>Spring and fall in Las Vegas bring comfortable temperatures during the day and pleasantly cool nights. April through June and September through November are almost ideal, with March likely being the busiest month. Hotel and ticket fees do, however, skyrocket during high season. </p>

            <p>Las Vegas summers are scorching, with temperatures frequently reaching triple digits. On the other hand, the low season brings fantastic hotel deals, and Las Vegas boasts the greatest pools around. During the winter, there are plenty of offers available, and the holidays bring the most extravagant celebrations. January brings the cold and the fewest tourists to the desert.</p>
