            <h2>When to plan a visit to Chennai?</h2>
            <p>Chennai is best visited in the winter, from October to February, during the pre-monsoon season. Since the summers are hot and the monsoons bring heavy rains and cyclones, this is the finest time of year to visit the metropolitan area. The city's climate is primarily hot and muggy due to its lovely coastal position.</p>

            <h3>Must visit places in Chennai and Hyderabad</h3>

            <h4>Koli Hills</h4>
