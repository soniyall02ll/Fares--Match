                        Allegiant Airlines is a well-known airline in the United States of America is considered one of
                        the major American airlines. It is particularly well known for the ultra-low-cost carrier model it
                        uses and the vast number of small and middle-sized cities of the country it provides flights to
                        which helps connect them to a great extent. The airlines focus on the leisure traffic that exists between these cities where connectivity by air
                        routes is considered to be limited and thus provides a means for travellers from such cities to
                        various locations.

                become significantly simpler and easier due to the advent of online procedures for the act instead
                of making reservations through airport ticket counters.

                mailing address of the travellers is given. Some of the airlines also have specific apps which help
                travellers to carry out these procedures. For example, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/allegiant-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx">
