            <h2>Best Time to Fly from Austin to Boston</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Boston's low season runs through the winter. Bring a warm jacket and some boots if you see Beantown covered in snow—or completely submerged in it because winters can be chilly. Another reason to visit in the winter is the possibility of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/hotels.aspx"><b>finding a fantastic hotel deal</b></a>. If you find winter too cold but summer and fall hotel rates too high, consider going in the early spring. If you want to go somewhere cheap, take a trip to the city in January or February with your parka. Boston sees the least amount of tourists during this time. Winter weekends may offer some excellent hotel deals because most hotels still accept business travellers, though fewer do so on the weekends. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The months hotels usually cost the most are May through October, with October ranking highest in recent years. The summer months of July and August have lower prices than the other months, probably because of the heat, which usually makes for a more enjoyable day at the beach than in town. By far, March is the best month to find the cheapest flights from Austin to Boston. To avoid paying a hefty price, booking your flights in advance online is strongly recommended. </p>
