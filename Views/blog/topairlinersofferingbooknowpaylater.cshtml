                <h3>The analysis of pay off flights in installments</h3>

                    <li>Even American airlines have the eligibility check for every purchase, so the "book now, pay later" option doesn't provide any flight deals or reductions in the final amount. </li>
                    <li>During the cancellation, there will be some confusion about the refund amount. But there are many "green flags" in this option too. It supports the dreams of an individual and a family. Most airlines offer this service at no service charge. </li>
