            <h3>Recent One-Way and Round-Trip Prices</h3>

One-way flight tickets start from $95, and round-trip flight tickets start from $180. Airfare ticket prices may fluctuate based on booking time, airline, and seat availability, so booking in advance is recommended.</p>
            <h2>Best Time to Book Cheap Flights from Memphis to Baltimore</h2>
            <p>On the other hand, the best time to book a flight ticket is the low-season time when you can secure the lowest fare, but here is the complete strategy to save more and use all these points.</p>
            <h3>Book in advance</h3>
            <p>It's best to book flights at least 6 to 8 weeks before departure. You must manage the booking in advance to lock in the lowest prices, as last-minute fares often result in higher fares.</p>
            <h3>Fly on cheapest days.</h3>
            <p>If you don't know the value of the cheapest days, we tell you one thing: You can find great deals on the cheapest days, such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays, because these days are typically the most affordable days to book flights.

            <h3>Consider Red-Eye or Early Morning Flights</h3>
            <p>Flights departing early morning or late night are usually cheaper than mid-day flights. Hence, always watch for the best deals on early morning flights. If you are comfortable with odd-hour flights, this is a great way to save more.</p>
            <h3>Don't forget to set fare alerts.</h3>
