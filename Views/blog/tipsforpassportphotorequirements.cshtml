                <h3>Submit a colour photo, not a black and white.</h3>
                <p>A user must submit a colour photo in the passport application because black-and-white images are not acceptable. The passport application is completely digital right now, and if you upload a picture in the wrong way, it impacts your application as well. You can also visit the US passport travel website to learn more about the requirements. Only colour photos are accepted by the agency.</p>
                <h3>Your photo must not be more than 6 months old</h3>
                <p>You must consider uploading a recent photo on the passport application or renewal application. You must submit a photo taken in the last six months, and this is the primary tip that you need to use.</p>
                <h3>You must use a clear image of your face</h3>
                <p>Your passport photo must be cleared, and an image of your face must be taken because uncleared photos are not acceptable. Therefore, try to upload a clear image of the face only without any filters or edits.</p>
                <h3>Avoid all editing software and phone apps.</h3>
                <p>Filters, artificial intelligence, computer software, and apps are not allowed to be uploaded for the passport application. Therefore, avoid all these edits and updates by using software because they only increase your problem with the form's acceptance.</p>
                <h3>No more selfies</h3>
                <p>People who take selfies should not do this because, for the passport form application, you need to upload the picture taken by someone else. No selfies are acceptable. Also, don't wear eyeglasses for your photos.</p>
                <h3>Use White Background</h3>
                <p>You must use the white background and background without any textures, lines and shadows. The transparent background is the most essential tip for people who need to follow when uploading pictures on a digital passport application in the US.</p>

The dimensions of passport size are important to follow, and you can upload the photo and crop the photo only. This is a free-to-use tool.</p>
                <h3>Submit Appropriate High-Resolution Photo</h3>
                <p>You can't upload grainy, pixelated and blurry images to your application and submit a high-resolution photo. The correct size of the passport photo is 2 X 2 inches or 51 X 51m.  The passport photos must be printed on a mettle or glossy quality photo, and do not change your photo by using any photo software.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Any damaged photo with holes is not accepted, and you must not submit a photocopy of the digital scan photo.
