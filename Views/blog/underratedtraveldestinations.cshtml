                        <h2>Time for booking flights </h2>

                        <p>Travellers should also keep their eyes peeled for any special discounts that might be available, especially around holidays like Christmas, New Year’s and Easter. Travellers should book their flights at least two months in advance which will allow them to keep track of every deal and discount that may be available on a first come first serve basis. </p>
                        <h3>Getting cheap flights</h3>
                        <p>Prices tend to be on the lower end during the low season due to the inevitable slowing down of business causing a tendency among business owners to offer incentives even at popular <b>adventure travel destinations. </b>These seasons in less popular destinations also allow travellers to enjoy their destinations in peace and appreciate the local culture as even fewer travellers turn up. </p>
                        <h3>Travel websites to the rescue</h3>
                        <p>Travellers should visit special travel websites such as<b> <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">Faresmatch booking</a> </b> site to make sure they get cheap flights to any location they want to visit. </p>
