            <p class="text-justify">Victoria Harbour is a well-known and very important port in Canada. It is located in the city of Victoria in the state of British Columbia and plays a major role in the country’s development. It is a port for both ships and seaplanes. Many tourists visit the cruise ships and ferry ships found here. This is also a viable entry point into the country for boats and flights. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">For many centuries, the area was home to the Coast Salish Songhees and Esquimalt Indigenous people. These people survived chiefly on simple occupations such as farming and fishing. The first Europeans to reach these shores were those aboard Princesa Real in the eighteenth century.The colonial powers who conquered these lands coveted the harbour’s control. However, the thick forest was a disadvantage, and the British chose to focus their efforts elsewhere. In the late nineteenth century, two of the first lighthouses in the area were built here. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The area saw accelerated development with the onset of the Gold Rush. The harbour, which had historically been a site of shipbuilding and commercial fishing, also slowly rose in fame as a popular tourist spot.
