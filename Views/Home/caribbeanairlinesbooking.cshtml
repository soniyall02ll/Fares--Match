            <p>
                Caribbean Airlines was one of the first airlines to provide a simplified <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/one-way-flights-deals.aspx">one-way cost </a>that included
                taxes and fees, allowing consumers to choose from a variety of fare combinations. Its on-time
                performance during the first two months of operation was 93.9 percent, above the industry standard
                of 85 percent. It also outperformed industry standards in January 2007, with a lost baggage rate of
                just 0.7 percent (less than one bag lost per thousand passengers). Booking your tickets to the
                destination that is served by Caribbean Airlines will not only be hassle-free but also a smart
                choice.
