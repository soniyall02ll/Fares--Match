                <p class="text-justify">Mexico is one of the most beautiful places to visit. The city is on the wish list of many travellers.

You can always hire a Mexico travel guide to get the most out of your vacation. </p>


                <h2 class="text-justify">Visiting and exploring the house where Frida Kahlo lived and died</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">You will find a small abode in Mexico now, the Frida Kahlo museum. She was born here, lived her entire life and died in the same place.

                <p class="text-justify">If you are interested in Frida's art and story, this Museum is worth a visit. You will have a nice experience inside the house and exploring numerous photographs and personal items. </p>


                <h2 class="text-justify">Visit the artisanal market</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">According to Mexico travel guide 2022, the artisanal market is 50 years old, and at every step to the market, an array of colours unfolds. Dive into the shelves of skulls, jugs, jaguar heads made with black mud, wood or with a Huichol decoration. You can also find traditional games, baskets made of leaf palms, saddlery, vases, pots and Talavera plates. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Replicas of prehispanic pieces of art are also displayed. The Artesania available in the country's tourist hotspots is easily available here in the market. Therefore the market is the best place to buy traditional Mexican handicrafts without travelling to Oaxaca or Chihuahua. </p>


                <h2 class="text-justify">Watch the sunrise from the 65m tall Revolution Monument</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Your dream to get a 360-degree view of Mexico City and sunrise is now fulfilled. You can now see the sunrise from the highest point of the Revolution Monument. The height is 65 metres. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The tour to the Monument includes coffee and pastry to help you get the energy to climb the Monument to admire the city's emblematic buildings like the Fronton Mexico, the Opera House, and the Chopo University Museum. The tour might take 2 hours so try to bring comfortable shoes and a coat. Take your time and go to explore the Revolution Monument. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Explore the Museums at night</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Look around the exhibitions in the city's cultural hotspots on the last Wednesday of every month. The Museum Night concept takes place every month in Mexico City. In other cities, it happens sporadically.

                <p class="text-justify">The sculpture includes the polychrome relief of the Goddess of the Earth known as Tlaltecuhtli. While exploring, you might also stumble upon a large circular monolith representing the Moon Goddess, Coyolxauhqui. Hence lovers of history are going to love this place for sure. </p>
