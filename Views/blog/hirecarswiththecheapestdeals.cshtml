                <p class="text-justify">While on vacation, one of the most important things is finding the proper means of transportation. Airlines are a great way to travel from one place to another or even to other countries. Tourists have many options for booking a flight or getting <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">cheap flight deals</a>. But once they land, they need to find proper means of transportation. One of the best methods is finding a car rental. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Tourists can <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/car-rental.aspx">rent a car</a> during their stay and travel to a different part of the tourist site for a certain amount. This also helps with the luggage and makes traveling a lot more enjoyable. After finding a car to rent, there are a few things the tourists need to keep in mind for cheap car hire and to make the journey more affordable. </p>


                <h2>Booking in advance is the right choice</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">When tourists go for car hire, they first notice the prices that go up the later the car is booked. Hence, it is advisable to book the car as early as possible; this reduces the overall costs of booking the car. Also, while booking a car, there are many options; tourists usually prefer rental cars, for example, sedans or hatchbacks. Booking a car in advance saves the hassle of having to compromise on car choice, and tourists can choose whichever car they feel comfortable in. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">For example, booking rental cars three months before the week of travel can save a lot compared to booking on the week. Tourists must realize that many people are searching for cars at a given time, and booking in advance saves the trouble of waiting in lines and getting access to a good car rental deal. While searching “<a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">cheap car rentals near me</a>”, tourists can get a good idea of the prices and availability of rental cars in their area. </p>


                <h2>Avoid renting cars at the airport</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">For tourists who travel by plane, rental car booking systems inside the airport can be a better option since they have just landed and don't have to look anywhere for cars. But, these services often cost more and have limited functionalities. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The cost of rental services inside the airport and generally more since those services have to pay establishment costs to the airport itself and hence have their prices hiked to balance the costs. </li>
                    <li>Looking for rental cars outside the airport can be quite cheap since those services do not impose extra charges. There are free shuttles to take people to and from the airport; hence, finding these rental services won't be a problem. </li>
                    <li>Suburb areas mostly allow tourists to book car rentals via companies that provide cars to tourists, and they can check out these places for more affordable traveling. Also, since they are suburbs, tourists might find locals to help them get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/hire-cars-with-the-cheapest-deals.aspx">cheap car deals</a>.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Try to avoid one-way fees</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">One-way fees are often applied to cars by the companies when tourists drop off the cars at a different place than where they picked them up. These costs are often not mentioned in the terms and conditions stated by the companies and can hinder the customers' experience. Hence the tourists are advised to compare fares while searching on the web for “rent a car deals”. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">If the tourists plan to drop the car off at where they picked it up, they do not have to worry about paying anything extra like one-way fees. Again, there are a lot of companies that offer no-extra-cost traveling, even if it's one-way. Hence, tourists are advised to research the best car rental deal. </p>


                <h3>Tourists must keep in mind brimming the cars</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">When car hire firms rent out cars to tourists, they often mention in their terms and conditions that the car has to be returned with a full tank. For this reason, airports often provide fuel refill stations inside their premises so tourists can refill their cars. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>However, fuel prices at the airport will be higher than anywhere else since they impose extra costs, such as establishment costs, on the refill charges. They know that the tourists will surely refill their cars at the nearest refill station possible and will not mind paying extra. But, to have the best travel experience, it is advised that the tourists do not refill from the airport. </li>

                    <li>Tourists must find a fuel refilling station within 5 miles of the airport and try to refill the vehicle there. This will lessen the overall costs of refilling the tank and returning the vehicle. </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Upgrades are often a trap</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Often, tourists are offered cars that are different from the model they had initially selected in the name of upgrades. During booking, tourists might not notice, or the companies might not discuss the actual costs of these upgrades, but during travel, these extra charges are imposed and lead to an overall increase in the traveling costs. Unless mentioned free in the paperwork, tourists must never opt for car upgrades during the booking of rentals. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">There are complaints from customers very often stating that the prices mentioned at the time of booking were increased later during the time of travel since the car model they asked for was unavailable and they were given a different model in the name of a car upgrade. It becomes quite a headache for tourists to go through all the added costs during traveling after they have already spent enough time arriving at the destination. Hence, it is advised that tourists avoid upgrades as much as possible unless it is mentioned that it is free. </p>


                <h4>Sudden Car Insurance charges</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Insurance coverage is a great feature that several rental companies offer their customers. It can help in case of any accident which causes damage to the vehicle or the passengers. Insurance can cover many things, including bumps or dents to the vehicle; most people take the insurance out of sheer peace of mind, but it is not required in general. Some companies even provide health insurance which can be quite useful at times. But, there are downsides to availing of the company's insurance policies. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">They often charge excess fee waivers, which cover the possible damages caused to the vehicle during the journey. If tourists prompt out of this, they must provide a credit card deposit that will be repaid once the vehicle is returned to the company without any damage. Some people might be surprised by the extra cost that the companies charge for insurance, but these are the reasons those charges pile up and do not let the tourists get their hands on cheap car rentals. </p>


                <h4>Checking the car for damage</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">When tourists rent a car from car rental companies, they are often given a list where all the known damages to the car are listed. It is advised that the tourists go through this list carefully and cross-check whether all the visible damages are listed. Once the car is returned to the company, the staff will check for any dents or damages to the car and charge the passengers accordingly. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Sometimes, if not checked properly, some new damages might show up when the car is returned to the company, leading to additional costs. These costs can be avoided if the passengers thoroughly review all the damages listed when booking the car. More often than, when booking cheap cars rent, tourists do not pay attention to the damage details, and it leads to extra costs piling up, making the trip not so cheap. </p>


                <h4>Paying for the toll pass</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">Toll passes can often add up to quite a hefty amount if travelers drive lots of miles in a country that charges tolls. There are a few things that tourists must keep in mind while traveling in a foreign country and looking for cheap car rentals: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Getting a toll pass directly from rental companies can save money. Since rental companies charge money on the vehicle itself, their charges for toll passes are quite low, meaning tourists can get toll passes for quite a less amount? </li>
                    <li>But, if the tourists are going to travel through heavy toll roads, then paying the money out of one's pocket is the way to go, and it will save enough money and time. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">Toll passes are quite important when traveling long roads, especially in a foreign country. Several countries don't have a toll system, but for countries that do, tourists must handle it tactfully. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Traveling in a foreign country can be quite stressful, especially when choosing the right transportation mode. Rental cars are often the answer to these problems, and tourists must find a way to book rental cars for an affordable price. Rental cars reduce the problems of traveling from one place to another and the cost of carrying luggage. Hence, you must check out rental car services as soon as possible! </p>
