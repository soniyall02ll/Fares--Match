                            <p class="text-justify">In 2022, do you want to embark on a solo adventure to rediscover the joys of travel? The planning for a solo trip is amazing. However, you need to understand that safety should be the priority. To ensure that the journey to new places is worth visiting, we have compiled the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/safest-places-for-solo-travelers.aspx">safest places to travel alone </a>around the globe for solo travelers in 2022.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Switzerland</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Switzerland is synonymous with stereotypes: lush greenery, scenic scenery, chocolate, cheese, and timepieces. Soaring Alpine Alps, historic churches, a bucketful of fresh air, dazzling sceneries, and verdant fields you'd like to run through are just a few of the reasons why it's one of the most wonderful countries on the planet. It is one of the few places in the world where everything runs on time, and it is regarded as one of Europe's safest places to travel alone, particularly one of the safe destinations for female solo travelers. If you enjoy snow sports or hiking, the Swiss Alps are a must-see destination; they are breathtakingly beautiful! </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">New Zealand</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">New Zealand has to be one of the most beautiful countries on the planet, with lush foliage, attractive coastline beaches, and the friendliest people. It is regarded as one of the world's most tranquil and least corrupt countries. Hence, it is good for traveling solo. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">New Zealand, unlike its neighbor Australia, has a very small number of harmful animals and insects, so you won't have to inspect your shoes every time you put them on! A fantastic location for individuals who enjoy the great outdoors and a little adventure– bungee jumping. </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Portugal</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Portugal is a fantastic option for anyone looking for a far less expensive but equally amazing vacation for traveling solo. Due to its beautiful coasts, attractive towns, and nice weather, it has become a popular tourist destination, but it is still one of the <b>safest countries to visit</b>.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">It's a good idea to come here at off-peak hours for a more peaceful experience. Try some exquisite Portuguese cuisine, relax on the beach, or take a stroll around Lisbon and Porto's neighborhoods. Portugal is an excellent choice for younger people seeking a fun, safe vacation without the high price tag. </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Ireland</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Ireland is a wonderful nation to visit, with some of the friendliest people and enough good craic (banter) to keep you occupied. Visit the craggy beaches and be amazed by the beauty, or hike the Giant's Causeway in Belfast or discover an excellent local bar in Dublin's city center. It may not always have the best weather, but it has some fantastic accents, beautiful scenery, and a positive attitude that makes it a completely safe place to visit. </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Finland</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">A small yet beautiful nation with an incredible selection of activities for all adventurous. Finland's people are also extremely friendly and accommodating, making it one of the greatest countries for solo travelers. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Another fantastic thing about Finland and other Scandinavian nations are that they are role models for sustainability and eco-friendly living, so if you want to be more environmentally conscious and learn more about how to save the world, a visit here will not disappoint. </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) </h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">The United Arab Emirates in the Middle East, which is home to some of the <b>world's most popular tourist sites</b>such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, is one of the countries that has issued Level 1 travel advice for the year 2022. The UAE, which is rated 26th in the world on the GPI, may have a low frequency of COVID-19 infections, according to the CDC. In comparison to other places of the world, crime rates are low, making the area safer. </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Iceland</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Iceland is a top-tier location for a stress-free journey, having been ranked as one of the world's safest nations to visit. With its beautiful rugged slopes, fascinating Nordic culture, and welcoming people, it is a true traveler's paradise that should be on everyone's bucket list. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Trying to see the Northern Lights is one of the nicest things to do in Iceland. Because of the low light pollution, the night sky comes alive with stars, and the lights take center stage with their captivating dance of green and blue colors, which is truly amazing! Going to a hot spring to take a plunge in naturally heated water while surrounded by ice is another must-do! </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Canada</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Yes, Canada is the best solitary adventure destination. The number of outdoor activities, National Parks, and epic road trips available in this country surely packs a punch. If you're visiting Canada for the first time, the sheer immensity of the country will strike you as the first thing you'll notice. It's quite substantial. </p>

                            <p class="text-justify">If you're looking for a truly memorable winter getaway, Alberta is the place to go. Without a doubt, this is Canada's most scenic province for outdoor adventurers, with the best ski fields and scenery. For this, you can simply </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Japan</h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Japan is a very safe country, perhaps one of the safest in the world, with crime rates far lower than in most Western countries. Even late at night, street crime is exceedingly infrequent. Japan is considered one of the <b>safe destinations for female solo travelers</b>. Your vacation should go easily if you keep your wits about you and use common sense, avoiding dark and arid lanes and strolling alone with unfamiliar individuals at night. </p>

                            <h2 class="text-justify">Kuala Lumpur </h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Malaysia's capital city has to be included, of course! It is, in reality, one of the country's most modern and secure cities. The public transportation system is fantastic, the living and working conditions for ex-pats are excellent, and there is much to see and do, from nightlife to culture. While there have been incidents of minor crime and pickpocketing, as in any large metropolis, violent crime is virtually unknown. If you keep your eyes open and are aware of your surroundings, your trip to Kuala Lumpur will be spectacular. </p>
