            <p>Your passport is the gateway to planning your upcoming international holiday because without holding this document, you can't go anywhere. Hence, if you are just a beginner in travel and now want to increase your travel boundaries by exploring other countries as well, then know the complete passport application process here. Here are the things to see while you apply for an online passport.</p>
            <h2>Fill the application form</h2>
            <p>You can download the US passport application form from the government's official website, travel.state.gov. Here, you can explore other forms for passport changes, edits, renewals, and application forms. Once you visit the official website, click on the passport form on the left side. Choose the form that you want to fill out. If you are a new applicant, you need to fill out the passport application form.</p>
            <h3>Keep the print of the form</h3>
            <p>After filling out the form, you must verify all the details that you entered twice because if anything is wrong with the spelling or something else, then it will become the reason for the rejection of the false statement appearing on your passport. You need to update the passport with the accurate details. Also, don't forget to print the form for future purposes.</p>
            <h2>Get Processing Time</h2>
            <p>The current processing time for a new passport application is 4 to 6 weeks, and expedited is 2 to 3 weeks. If you need the passport urgently, you need to make an appointment for international travel within 14 calendar days. If you need the passport sooner, you can also call the agency's information center number.</p>
            <h2>What is the cost of a passport application?</h2>
            <p>Another important thing is passport fees. The fees are different for different applications. For example, if you are a first-time applicant or an adult who is 16 years or older, the passport book fee is $130, the passport card fee is $30, and the joint fee is $160. You need to fill out different forms for all three.</p>
            <h3>Passport Renewal Fees</h3>
            <p>On the other hand, if you want to renew your old passport, the passport renewal fee will be the same: the passport book fee is $130, the passport card fee is $30, and the joint fee is $160.</p>
            <h2>Submit a good photo</h2>
            <p>In the next step, you need to submit a good photo for the passport application; after all, it will appear for many years on your passport. You need to submit a colour photo, and a recent photo is essential—it should not be older than the last six months. Try to avoid any kind of self-photo or selfie. Also, take off your eyeglasses while taking the photos.</p>
            <h2>Get Evidence of US Citizenship</h2>
            <p>You can't apply for a US passport if you don't hold evidence of US citizenship. You need to submit one document that confirms your identity in the US. Therefore, it's all about the major things that you need to apply for a US passport.</p>
            <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
            <p>Applying for a US passport online means you need to check all primary resources or authentic resources to get the essential documents required and the significant steps for the application process. Thanks to the government's online website services, people can directly visit and apply for various passport applications and pay the fees online.</p>
