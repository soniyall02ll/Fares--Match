                    <p>
                        LATAM Airlines Group was formed by the merger of LAN Airlines and TAM Airlines on June 22,
                        2012. The combined airline group operates a large network of international and Latin
                        American passenger and cargo services. LATAM Airlines debuted a new logo in August 2015, and
                        the company plans to work on a new corporate brand over three years. With the launch of
                        LATAM Cargo and LATAM Airlines in 2016, a phased rollout of the LATAM identity began.

            <p>
                LAN and TAM continue to operate under their current brands, with headquarters in Santiago, Chile, and
                Sao Paulo, Brazil, respectively. The combined airline group is publicly traded on the Santiago, New
                York, and Sao Paulo stock exchanges. With approximately 31.47 percent ownership, the Cueto Group
                controls the airline group Qatar Airway.

        <h2>The LATAM Online Check-in Policy: </h2>
        <p>
            To ensure that you are traveling with LATAM and to receive your boarding permit, check-in online and
            ahead of time. Fares Match gives you all the information you need to organize your journey and board
            the airline without delay and stress. Checking in online takes less than two minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check-in may take longer if you're flying internationally since Airlines need to ask you particular
            questions before you travel to your destination country. For <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights.aspx">international flights</a>, you must arrive
            between 4 and 70 minutes before departure and between 2:30 and 70 minutes before departure for
            domestic flights.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note- TSA Pre Check is a program that LATAM is a part of. More than 200 US airports will
            benefit from this program, which will make the security screening procedure faster and easier. You
            won't have to take off your shoes, belts, or jackets, and you won't have to take your laptop out of
            your luggage. This will make the process go more smoothly, quickly, and conveniently for you.
        </p>
        <h2>LATAM Baggage Policy: </h2>

            For any <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/latam-airlines-flights.aspx">LATAM Airlines booking</a>,
            you may bring one carry-on bag and one personal item at no additional cost, under your care and
            responsibility. Except in the first and exit rows, you may carry a personal item (a purse, a laptop
            bag, a baby diaper bag, etc.) under the seat in front of you.
        </p>
        <p>

            hold, or with LATAM Cargo, depending on its size, weight, and breed. Keep in mind that only dogs and
            cats are domestic pets accepted on LATAM Airlines flights.
