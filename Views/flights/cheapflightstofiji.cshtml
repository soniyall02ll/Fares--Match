            <h3>What are the best tips to get cheap flights to Fiji?</h3>
            <p>A good suggestion on how to get cheap air tickets to Fiji is to try and check the prices on the various booking sites like Google Flights, Expedia, or even Kayak. Additionally, setting price alerts, booking in advance, and increasing the flexibility of the travel period will all assist in getting cheaper prices.</p>
            <h3>Are there any direct flights from the US to Fiji?</h3>
            As of this moment, it is regrettable that there are no such reaches from Continental USA to Fiji. However, most flights have connecting airports. For example, the flights of Fiji Airlines are direct to Nadi International Airport from LAX.</p>
