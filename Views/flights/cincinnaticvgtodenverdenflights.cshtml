            <h2>When to book flights? </h2>
            <p>Generally, for <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-denver.aspx"><b>cheap flights to Denver</b></a>, it is advisable to make your bookings one to three months in advance. For travels within the same country, this time usually offers the best rates to the consumer. The earlier a person books a flight, the more likely they are to secure a ticket at a cheaper rate than when the date of the flight is nearing. The same can be applied to booking flights during weekdays rather than weekends or using low-fare calendars as this is usually marked with more affordable prices. It is also worth comparing fares with the help of special services and setting up alerts to monitor the fares’ changes and to catch the best prices.</p>
