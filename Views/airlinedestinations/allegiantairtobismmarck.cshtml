                    <p class="text-justify">Bismarck is an essential and highly populated city in North Dakota. This American city is well known as a centre of growth and development, which enables it to provide its inhabitants with a high quality of life. The city’s rapid and visible urbanization has led to its recognition by the prestigious Forbes magazine. The history of Bismarck is very closely linked with the nearby town of Mandan. To this day, they form a United and cohesive administration unit. The Mandan tribe once occupied this area before the arrival of European settlers. The Hidatsa and the Arikara were also known to have close ties to this area. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The first European settlers in this area arrived in the late nineteenth century. They introduced railroads to the area and built the town around the railroad industry, which led to an influx of immigrants seeking work in the industry. Around this time, the city was given its modern name to honour the German politician Otto von Bismarck. This was done as a clever ploy by a railroad company established here to attract more German immigrants and, consequently, their investment. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">The city became popular after discovering gold in its nearby hills and later as a point for freight ships. Mining became a point of contention among the white settlers and the native Lakota, who strongly opposed the exploitation of their land. The city, however, continued to develop and became the capital of the state when it was formed in the late nineteenth century. The best way to get the cheapest deals on flights to Bismarck is to plan trips carefully at least a few months before take-off.
