                <h4>Some tips and tools to get the most out of the Black Friday Ticket Deals</h4>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Try to search by months and not by dates</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Use the 'cheapest month' option of any flight finder app to see all your options in one place. Once the airlines release their Black Friday deals, you will be able to see them on the results page alongside all other flight options, so their month view will allow you to quickly shift through and find the cheapest flights to your destination. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Make sure to find the best deals anywhere in the world</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">With the 'Explore Everywhere' feature of the flight finder sites, you can discover the best deals from your chosen airport to anywhere in the world. You can find deals to all of your favorite under-the-radar destinations like these by searching for flights to 'Everywhere'. You might end up discovering your new favorite place. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Be clear about where you can go and what you need to get there</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">To find out more about the latest restrictions in your chosen destination or to check which countries are open, you can easily use the live Covid-19 travel map of the flight finder sites, which is updated daily. If you have already decided where to go but are feeling a bit confused about what you need to get there, the Covid-19 travel hub of the flight finder sites will take you through everything you need to prepare for your trip, which includes vaccination certificates to PCR tests and travel insurance. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Try to book flexible tickets</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">During the pandemic, travel was so unpredictable that most airlines introduced flexible ticket policies. Some of these still exist hence you can easily make changes to your booking in case the unexpected happens. If you want to stay one step further, try to pair it up with travel insurance available when booking flights through flight finder apps as a different way to protect your trip and travel confidently. In this way, you can enjoy your peace of mind. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Set up the price alerts: </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">If you find the price alerts option, try to set it up to get to know if the prices go up and down. Most of the Black Friday flight deals do not last; hence if you want to get ahead, it is wise to set up a few flight alerts on your chosen routes before the sales begin, as there could be a major price drop. Black Friday will take place this year on November 25, but many airlines will start their sales a few days before. </p>
