            <h2>Keep eyes on last-minute deals</h2>
            <p>Several hotel booking websites and apps offer last-minute sales and clearance sales wherein the users get access to some of the lowest prices on hotel bookings and rooms. At the last minute, the hotels have to rent out the remaining rooms, so they need to lower the prices as much as possible. This is why there are huge sales during this time, and people rush to the booking websites to grab a good deal on hotel rooms. But there are some drawbacks to this too:</p>

            <p>Most of the time, the sales are not authentic, and tourists must be aware of fraudulent websites. Since people start renting hotels in a rush due to the price drop, they often don't check the authenticity of the websites.</p>
            <p>The discounts in the last-minute sales are often given at hiked prices, meaning tourists do not get a proper discount; rather, they pay almost the same amount in the name of a discount.</p>
            <p>Some deals do not provide direct discounts; rather, they give bundled rewards which are often better avoided than taken.</p>
            <p>Although there are some downsides to chasing last-minute deals, if tourists can get their hands on authentic websites, they are one of the best ways to save money on hotel bookings.</p>

            <h2>Sharing a room in a hotel</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best ways to save money on hotel bookings is by sharing a room with a fellow companion. Sharing a room means the total load of the hotel costs gets divided into equal parts among the travelers; hence, no one has to bear the full cost of the room. Tourists often book separate rooms for each other even if they are traveling together. This leads to every person paying the full cost of the room, even if they do not use all the amenities.
                <br>
                If 2 or 3 people share the room, the total cost remains the same, but each person has to bear less than the original. Although this is a great way of saving money on hotel rooms, it is quite a hassle if travelers need privacy. Privacy is hampered if the room is shared among people, but for people who are traveling together and don't mind sharing their room, it is a great way of reducing hotel costs.
            </p>

            <h3>Comparing hotel prices is a must</h3>
            <p>
                Like flight tickets, hotel prices need to be compared and checked properly. Otherwise, the users won’t find the best deal for them and might end up paying more than they should. Comparing fares is not an easy task and needs a lot of research and hard work to find the perfect deal.
                <br>
                One of the first steps in comparing prices is knowing the actual requirements. Once the requirements are noted, try to find similar hotels on different sites and check their prices.<br>Bookmarking pages is a good way of keeping a record of all the sites visited during research, and it helps in quickly switching to a different site to compare the prices. During this period, users are recommended not to stay incognito since keeping track of pages and bookmarks becomes a hassle if the browser history is not stored.<br>
                Comparing fares is a tenacious job and can lead to a loss of patience, but users must remember that this hard work will only lead to better deals for them.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Staying longer in hotels</h3>
            <p>Hotels often charge their customers based on the length of their stay, and the shorter the stay, the higher the cost. This is why tourists should ensure they stay in the hotel for at least a couple of days to avoid getting charged more. It is quite scientific for the hotels to charge more for shorter stays; since they have to clean up the rooms and make proper arrangements all over again once the occupant leaves; frequently doing these means they have to pay more for the services and hence must increase the prices to accommodate the costs. The vacations and trips must be planned accordingly so that staying in a hotel means spending at least 2 or 3 days or as many are needed to avoid getting charged anything extra.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Coupons often provide great rewards</h3>
            <p>
                One of the best ways to get awesome rewards on hotel bookings is using coupons. Coupons are often earned through previous bookings or partnered services upon completing various tasks as rewards.
                <br>
                Coupon codes can be earned through booking a flight, renting a car, or even shopping on a particular website. There are a thousand ways to get access to coupons. The rewards provided by coupons can vary from flat discounts to extra amenities during a stay at certain hotels.<br>
                There are also a lot of fraudulent coupons available on the internet, and users must make sure they are using the proper coupon.<br>

                Users often search “best hotels near me,” and many hotels pop up, but booking a hotel is only a part of the trip. Booking a flight is often more of a headache for tourists.

Being a flight finder, FaresMatch offers its users exciting deals and offers on flights, and users can compare fares, book a flight, or just simply search for flights of their preferences. FaresMatch has got you covered when it comes to flight bookings.
