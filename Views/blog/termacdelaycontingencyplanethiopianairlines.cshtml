                <h2>Cancellation 24 hours Policy</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">It is to pay attention to the requirements and the position of the passengers; Ethiopian Airlines comes up with the 24 hours cancellation policy. It offers elasticity and advantages to passengers when it comes to booking their tickets. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">As per their Cancellation policy, the passengers should cancel a flight that they have booked within 24 hours of ticket purchase. Then Ethiopian Airlines offers a complete refund airline with your cost of the ticket but if the booking is of a week prior then the Ethiopian airlines have full rights to change. </p>
                <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Ethiopian Airlines always work within the comfort zone of the passengers they offer <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/ethiopian-airlines-cancellation-policy.aspx">Ethiopian Airlines flight cancellations</a> without any hassle. Even the passengers have the facility to go for the refund online just with little formality of filling the refund request form on the official site of Ethiopian Airlines i.e., site http://www.ethiopianairlines.com/. It is to note that the airlines give a refund to eligible Ethiopian Airlines <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">flight tickets</a> taking care that they have been canceled in the given period. They don’t give a refund if the ticket has expired. The processing can take some time around 7-10 working days. There is one more possibility that in case of the cancellation is done from the Ethiopian airline's side because of some unavoidable circumstances then they provide the compensation so that they can opt for the other flight. Thus, one need not worry much about cancellation and the refund process as it is very clear and transparent with Ethiopian airlines. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">The cancellation fee which is charged is between $100 to $500 which is applicable if the passenger has canceled the ticket after 24 hours of booking. If the cancellation is within 24 hours, then the fee ranges from $100 to $400. </p>

                <h3>Ethiopian airlines change flight penalty</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">There is a great facility with Ethiopian Airlines where they are permitting their customers to change their reservations if any emergencies even after checking in online i.e., Ethiopian airlines change flight penalty. But for this, they are going to charge a penalty. This means that passengers of the Ethiopian are allowed to change the flight details i.e., its date and name, giving a great relaxation to the customers. To do this there are two conditions which are governed, number one is that all this has to be performed at the Ethiopian company's reservation center, and can be done a day before the scheduled trip. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">But to be very true most airlines don’t want that the passengers should opt for changing their tickets as it creates a lot of effort. One should be very much aware of the fact that the reduced prices are offered with restrictive conditions and thus in case of change, it creates inconvenience as lower the fare more of restrictions included. Thus, it’s difficult to change discounted tickets. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Thus, please note that in case of change Ethiopian airlines charge a processing fee of € 30 as a penalty. For more details, look to the official site. </p>
