                                <p>Refund policy can often feel like flying through turbulence. But don’t worry, because here we are with a clear and straightforward guide to understand <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/frontier-airlines-refund-policy.aspx"><b>Frontier Airlines refund policy</b></a>. Whether your plans have changed or Frontier has, here is what you need to know about getting a refund. Frontier is a leading low-cost airline of the United States that is known for its cheapest flight deals. Therefore, if you are also thinking of booking the cheap Frontier Airlines flights, then you must check the policy, refund details, and policies here. </p>
<H2>The 24-Hour Rule: Your Best Bet for a Full Refund</H2>
<p>Yes, this airline also offers the 24-hour rule, and this is your golden ticket to a full refund. You can cancel the ticket for a full refund to your original form of payment if you book a ticket at least 7 days before the departure. Here, you need to understand how it works. You must cancel the ticket within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket. If you meet these two conditions, you will get all your money back, including any extras you purchased like seat selections or baggage fees. For any travel decision, make your changes in the booking within the 24-hour window. </p>
<H3>When Frontier Cancels or Significantly Changes Your Flight? </H3>
<p>There are many times when the airline is the one to change the plans. If the airline cancels your flight or makes a vital schedule change, you are entitled to a refund. What is “significant change”? It refers to the delay of several hours, a change in the departure or arrival airport, or a switch from a nonstop to a connecting flight. First, you need to accept the new flight, and the airline will likely offer you an alternative flight. If you take it, you won’t be eligible for a refund. You can also request a full refund, and if the new arrangements don’t work for you, you can decline the offer and request a full refund. </p>
<H2>What If YOU Need to Cancel? (Voluntary Cancellations) </H2>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/refund-cancellation.aspx"><b>cancel your flight</b></a> and you are outside of the 24-hour window, getting a full cash refund is less likely unless you have purchased a specific type of ticket. The standard tickets are non-refundable after 24 hours. If you cancel, you will likely be issued a travel credit for the value of your ticket minus a cancellation fee.
Standard Tickets: Generally, these are non-refundable after 24 hours. If you cancel, you will likely be issued a travel credit for the value of your ticket, minus a cancellation fee. </p>
