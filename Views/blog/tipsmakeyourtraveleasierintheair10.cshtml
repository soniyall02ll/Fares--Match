                <h2 class="text-justify">1. Land on Digital for Every Single Travel Task: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">No matter you want to check flight status or complete early check-in? You need to land on digital platform for every single travel task. When you are not interested in wasting your time in ticket counter lines, you can download the mobile phone applications of the airlines to complete these tasks on a digital model. For example, flying with Alaska means you must already download <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/alaska-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Alaska Airlines</b></a> Mobile Application and print the digital boarding pass for check-in. From the same application, you can track the flight status to manage your travel.

Thus, we can say that landing on a digital platform gives you easiness of traveling. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">2. Try to Reach Airport Early: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Every traveler should try to reach the airport early to avoid the last-minute hassles. Many times, passengers do not take time backup, and that's why missing the flight. For domestic flights, you need to reach the airport at least 2 hours before your flight departure, and for the International flight, at least 3 hours before your flight departure. It is the 9th tip to make your travel easier. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">3. Enroll in Trusted Travel Program: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Nowadays the craze of travel programs is also increasing day by day in the passengers. They love to join these programs because they earn massive rewards and miles points while booking tickets with an airline. For example, SkyMiles is the program of <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>Delta Airlines</b></a>. When you are a SkyMiles member, you will get so many extra advantages for travel, such as early boarding, check-in, preferred seating options, and many more. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">4. Print Your Bag Tags: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">To reduce the time of security check-in, you can print your carry-on bag tags in-advance. This is the right way to go through fast from the security line. Passengers can print bag tags at home to save time at the airport seucurity lines. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">5. Carry Only Smart Bags: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Smart bags have the feature of a power bank or lithium battery-powered electric motor for travel. These devices must be removed without the use of the tool, and only these bags are allowed in the airlines' carry-on baggage policy. Due to a lack of knowledge about the airlines baggage policy, passengers do not know that bags with non-removable lithium batteries, power banks, or batteries are not allowed in the baggage policy because they require a tool to remove the battery. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">6. Always Follow Carry-On Bags Instruction: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Don't forget to read the carry-on baggage instruction of the airline in which you are going to travel. Every airline has a baggage policy with size and weight restrictions. To save your time at the airport and avoid carry-on-baggage charges, you must first read the baggage policy. For example, when you are traveling on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx"><b>United Airlines</b></a>, and then read the luggage terms on the official site of United's luggage page. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">7. Check Your Carry-on Liquids List (Allow or Not Allowed and How Much): </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Passengers can also carry liquids in aircraft, but sometimes they do not know what kind of liquor items are prohibited in airlines. Thus, try to check the list of carry-on liquid (permitted or not allowed) and the quantity allowed by your airline. If you do not follow the instructions, the security professionals at the security checkpoint will also stop you. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">8. Always Keep an Eye on Prohibited Item of Airline: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">No matter you are traveling in the Emirates or Turkish? You need to check the list of prohibited items of the airline to avoid the last-minute hassles during the check-in. For example, most airlines not allowed lithium-ion batteries and devices. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">9. Pet Travel Must Pre-plan: </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Passengers who want to travel with a pet in an airline should know the basic rules and terms of the airline's pet travel. If you had not done the pre-planned travel for pet reservations, then it may also be complicated for you. Many airlines are not allowed pet travel in first-class or business class cabins. Thus, read about the pet policy of your airline completely. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">10. Be Attentive For Security Line: </h2>
