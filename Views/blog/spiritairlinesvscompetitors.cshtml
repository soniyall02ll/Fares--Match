This is the major and low-cost airline in the United States, and the airline is offering affordable travel tickets to the passengers. However, baggage fees and seat selection fees are pretty much higher for the people. Budget carriers are always affordable in terms of airfare but expensive in terms of baggage fees and seat selection. This blog is all about the budget carriers that are against or the big competition for <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/spirit-airlines-flights.aspx"><b>Spirit Airlines flights</b></a> right now in the market.</p>
                <h2>1. Pricing: Spirit Airlines Leads the Pack</h2>
                <p>This is the cheapest airline in the United States. In the market or industry, right now, the airline is offering the lowest airfare prices in comparison to other low-cost airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest. The low prices are the best thing for the passengers, but there are additional fees on the baggage, onboard amenities and seat selection. Southwest, Frontier, and JetBlue are the main competitors for this airline because Southwest offers free two checked bags with no change fee. On the other hand, JetBlue provides a more inclusive experience with free in-flight entertainment and snacks, but its fares are typically higher than Spirit.</p>
                <h2>2. Baggage Policies: Pay as You Go</h2>
                <p>Spirit Airlines offers the option of “pay for what you use” for the baggage. However, passengers can carry one personal item, but a carry-on and checked bag fee are applicable. The main competitors of the airline baggage fee are Southwest and Frontier Airlines. Southwest offers the two checked bags for all passengers and Frontier offers both carry-on and checked baggage in terms of baggage fee. On the other hand, JetBlue includes one carry-on bag free.</p>
                <p>You must pack light if you want to travel at an affordable price with Spirit flights because luggage is not free. You can carry all the essentials in one personal item.</p>
                <h2>3. In-Flight Experience: Minimal vs. Comfort</h2>
                <p>The airline offers a no-frills experience to the passengers, and for the meals, you must pay. Complimentary food and drinks are not part of the Spirit Airlines flight. On the other hand, Southwest is the big competition in terms of in-flight meals and snacks because this airline offers free snacks and drinks. Also, with Southwest you can enjoy the free live TV and free Wi-Fi for free but Frontier charges for snacks and drinks and offers limited in-flight entertainment. JetBlue offers complimentary snacks, drinks, and free Wi-Fi on all flights, along with seatback screens for entertainment.</p>
