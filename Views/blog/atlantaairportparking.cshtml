            <p>One of the major airports in the United States, also known as the busiest airport, is Atlanta International Airport. Airport parking facilities are also very high-end, and on-airport parking options are available.  For long-term and daily parking, $30/day (up from $19) charges are applicable. There is a wide range of parking options available at the Atlanta airport, both on-site and off-site. Charges are different and accommodate different needs and budgets. It is the leading and biggest airport, and that’s why parking demand is always high. Here is a breakdown of standard parking options and considerations. </p>

            <h2>On-Airport Parking</h2>
            <p>On-site parking is a much safer and more accessible option at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. This type of parking is available for both domestic and international terminals. Therefore, it is more convenient but can be expensive. Hourly parking charges are different for the North and South Hourly Lots and the International Hourly Lot. However, this type of parking is best for short stays, picking up/dropping off passengers. For the first hour, parking charges are around $3 to $10, and rates have recently increased. The parking cost at <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/atlanta-airport.aspx"><b>Atlanta International Airport</b></a> may increase and range from $36 to $100, depending on the particular lot and recent rate changes.

These lots also often have shuttle service to the terminals. </p>

            <h2>Off-Airport Parking</h2>
            <p>On the other hand, you can also choose off-airport parking, and many third-party parking providers and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/hotels.aspx"><b>hotels</b></a> near ATL offer off-site parking with shuttle services.
