                            <p class="text-justify">Travelling is probably some tourists’ favorite hobby. However, while traveling internationally, thinking about their travel and tourism laws and regulations is probably the last thing on their mind. The travel brochures and websites are always filled with beautiful pictures of the country, making the tourists book their flights and invest their money and time in the tour without any second thought. </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">However, due to this recent pandemic, tourists now must learn thoroughly about the tourism laws and restrictions of the country.
