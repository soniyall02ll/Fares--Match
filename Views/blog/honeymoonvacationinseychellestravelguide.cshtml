                <h2 class="text-justify">Pro Travel Guide:</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Whether you are <b>planning a romantic honeymoon in Seychelles</b> with your better half or planning a solo vacation, the places in Seychelles are worth it. Also, make note that the Seychelles Islands have year-round sunshine, so there isn't a terrible time to visit for a vacation in Seychelles. The best months to visit are April through May and October through November for the greatest weather. If you travel during these months, you can expect moderate weather that is ideal for sunbathing, animal watching, and scuba diving with your partner or even if you are alone or on a <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/family-travel-deals.aspx">family trip</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">During the summer (June to September), the weather is cool and dry, and there are a lot of tourists. If you're visiting during the summer, you'll want to book your accommodations and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">Flights Ticket Booking</a> at least a few months ahead of time and prepare to pay peak-season rates. Lastly, we would like to inform you that although the tap water in Seychelles is safe to drink, it is high in chlorine, thus many people choose to drink bottled water. If you visit during the summer, you may notice that the water is shut off for a few hours each day to preserve water. Make sure you don’t lack water; get the water bottles in stock as you’ll need them while you explore places. </p>
