            <p> FaresMatch is more like an online travel search engine than an online travel booking site. They look for bargains on flights from Los Angeles International (LAX) to Berlin Brandenburg (BER) and other segments through different carriers. Here’s the catch, FaresMatch presents possible <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com"><b>flight tickets</b></a> but does not reveal final costs with carrier charges such as baggage. It directs you to the airline’s website to finalize the booking. Confirm fares and other details with the airline company before deciding. It is useful for searching for promotions; however, for the most up-to-date pricing and details, it is best to go directly to the airline’s website. While FaresMatch is not a booking engine, it is designed to help you secure the best fare on a flight. Here’s how it works:  </p>


            <ul>
                <li>Go to FaresMatch and input your travel information, for instance, Dallas to Toronto flights/ flights from Dallas to Tokyo</li>
                <li>FaresMatch looks for airlines.</li>
                <li>It displays possible fares, not final ones (airline fees, such as baggage, are not included).</li>
                <li>It only offers links to the airline’s website if you get a good deal on FaresMatch.</li>
                <li>It is always advisable to compare the fares, fees, and baggage allowance with the airline before booking the ticket.</li>
            </ul>
