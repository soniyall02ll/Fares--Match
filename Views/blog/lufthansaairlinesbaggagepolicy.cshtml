                            <h3>2.9). Policy to Know of Lufthansa for Items Over 32 KG: </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">If any item of baggage crosses the weight limit of 32 KG in the Lufthansa Airlines then it will not be accepted as travel baggage and you can also be sent this item as air freight. You can also read about the basic rules of excess baggage on the Lufthansa Airlines Official Site. If you want to get the information about air freight originating in Germany then you can get this from the Lufthansa Cargo in Germany and for other destinations, you can go through the local Lufthansa Cargo Sales Officer. </p>
                            <h3>2.10). Lufthansa Excess Baggage Basic Rules to Know: </h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">As we know, items over 23 KG counted as excess baggage with the Lufthansa Airlines Booking. Flat rates are applicable for the special baggage and the excess baggage. Flat rates are also applicable for sports baggage that exceeds the term of free baggage allowance. There are so many rules, limited capacities, and various regulations at partner airlines and that’s why Lufthansa always recommends flyers for the reservations of excess baggage early because at the last minute you may not get the reservations for this. You can register for the excess baggage with Lufthansa in your travel agency, Lufthansa Airlines Customer Service by telling your booking code and last but not least you can also book by yourself at the “My Booking” Section of the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/lufthansa-airlines.aspx">Lufthansa Airlines Official Site</a>.  </p>
                            <h4>A). Excess Baggage Rule in Economy, Premium Economy, and Business &amp; First Class: </h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">The maximum allowed weight in these two fare classes is 32 KG and dimensions should not great than 158 CM. For the first and business class passenger luggage dimensions must not exceed 292 CM. The flat rate will be charged for all those Lufthansa air Guests whose checked baggage corresponds to the permitted number but also exceed the limit of weight and size. For the economy class guests on particular routes, Lufthansa Air also offers discounted flat rates on the second piece of checked baggage for the passengers. On the other hand, if you want to know about another airline's excess baggage costs then directly contact the operating airline. </p>
                            <h4>B). Extra Baggage in Economy Class Light Fare :</h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">Nothing is free in the economy class light fare of Lufthansa in terms of baggage for the passengers. You have to pay a fee for the luggage weighing up to 23 KG in this fare class. Prices are applicable on the additional bag of luggage in the light tariff and you can also add the extra bag under the “My Booking” section of the Main Menu of Lufthansa Official Site. </p>
                            <h4>C). Refundable Terms in Light Tariff: </h4>
                            <p class="text-justify">You must know about the fact that the first bag of luggage in the economy class light fare is non-refundable. If your bag is heavy or larger than as you’re mentioned when you book for the baggage (over 23 KG or 158 CM) then flat rates are also applicable for the excess baggage. </p>
