Above all, if you go at this prime time, you'll avoid the November-starting "season" price increases.

            <h2>Top Naples attractions </h2>
            <b>The Archaeological Museum</b>
            <p>This one-stop shop for Roman relics in Naples holds the largest collection of artefacts found during the excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum. </p>
            <b>Gesu Nuovo</b>
            <p>A large plaza in the western section of the city is the location of the church named Gesù Nuovo, whose façade has an almost brutalist appearance. Explore its absurdly lavish interiors when you have some free time. </p>
            <b>Piazza Bellini</b>
            <p>A gathering place for Naples’ youth and inebriated, this bar-lined piazza erupts with residents, visitors, and students at aperitivo time (and beyond). </p>
            <b>Pompeii</b>
            <p>OF course, you are already familiar with Pompeii, but visiting it in person is very astounding. Even on a Saturday, when the town’s immaculately manicured streets draw just as many people as Oxford Circus, they are nonetheless unsettling. </p>
            <b>Pio Monte della Misericordia</b>
            <p>Located in the Forcella neighborhood at the less well-known end of Via Tribunali, this little church is home to one of the few remaining Caravaggio paintings. </p>
            <b>Via De Tribunali</b>
            <p>It’s one of the few things about which Neapolitans can agree: Via Tribunali has the tastiest pizza. Anywhere along “Pizza Alley” serves the famous fluffy, burnt crust, but Sorbillo is the Rolls Royce of pizza joints; if you can wait in line, it’s well worth it. </p>
