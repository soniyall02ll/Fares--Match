                <h2>Cancellation policy </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">According to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/bangkok-airways-cancellation-policy.aspx">Bangkok Airways’ cancellation policy</a>, you can cancel a flight ticket within 24 hours of booking without paying any cancellation fee. If you miss the cancellation window to cancel the flight tickets, you will have to pay the cancellation fee based on the time of cancellation, the destination, and the class of tickets purchased. Also, if you book your ticket from a kiosk or your ticket is not to/from/within the United States, or if you cancel your flight after 24 hours of booking, or if your flight’s departure at the time of booking is less than 1 week later, you don’t qualify for a penalty-free refund. </p>

You will receive a refund only for the unused part of the ticket. You must apply for the refund within a year of the ticket’s issue date, or the airline will not entertain the request. </p>
