            <h3>Perfect time for a visit to Burbank</h3>
            <p>The best travel is during the spring from April to June, and early fall from September to November. These months offer weather that is clear as the summer but not hot or humid as a consequence of summer time. The winter is also a good time to visit even though winter is not a popular season for tourists to travel around the world, few people still consider it to be a good time to visit the northern states. While it might not be as predictably pleasant as shoulder seasons you can often be treated to events in warm sunny weather. Similarly, winter in California is reckoned with low travel time and therefore if you do not travel during Christmas time or the end of the year you are assured of discounted hotel rates and fewer holidaymakers. </p>
