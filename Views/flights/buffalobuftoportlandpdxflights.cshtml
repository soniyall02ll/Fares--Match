            <h2>FAQs</h2>

            <h3>How did the city of Portland develop?</h3>

            <p>The city has always been an important hub of economic activity as a prosperous port city due to its location inspiring organised crimes and racketeering in the decades before the Second World War. It was the industrial boom which almost immediately followed the war that brought about true change in the town by letting it become a hub for counterculture, liberalism and progressive values undoing the infamy it had gained previously.</p>

            <h3>Why is Portland called the City of Roses?</h3>

            <p>Portland has been known as the city of roses since the late nineteenth century when this name was bestowed upon it by the visitors to an Episcopal Church Convention. The city has since honoured its name time and time again through various efforts such as organizing the Portland Rose Festival and the International Rose Test Garden every year since it was first started in the early twentieth century.</p>

This brings prices which have already been falling since autumn to an all-time low allowing travellers to get the cheapest tickets to and lowest accommodation rates at the location of their choice.</p>

            <h3>What is a good place to visit in Buffalo?</h3>
