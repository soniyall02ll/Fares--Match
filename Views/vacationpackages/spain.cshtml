                        <h2>The Energy of Barcelona</h2>
                        <p>Barcelona is a lively urban concoction of buildings, beaches, and raving nightlife. With the Sagrada Familia designed by Gaudi as the main attraction to the animated La Rambla, the city is a hub of art and history. Fans of the beach can take a break by the Mediterranean, and gourmets can enjoy tapas and fresh seafood in small alleyway restaurants.</p>

                        <h2>Charming Seville of the South</h2>
                        <p>Seville gives Spanish romance a completely new meaning by using Moorish palaces, flamenco dances, and the roads lined with orange trees. Take a sip of local wine in the courtyard or attend a local dance performance.</p>
