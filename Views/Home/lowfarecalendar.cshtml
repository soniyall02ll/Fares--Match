                    <h2>What is a Low-Fare Calendar?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Low Fare Calendar is an easy-to-use calendar search tool present on the airline's official
                        website
                        and also on other OTAs. Low Fare Calendar displays a month-by-month calendar with the
                        starting price
                        of airline tickets each day. Hence this makes it easy for the traveler to see which dates
                        have the
                        cheapest departure and return fares. By booking tickets using the low-fare calendar, you
                        make sure
                        you have a lot to spend on your dream destination.
                        <br>
                        Currently, travelers have a wide range of options to choose from while they make a plan for
                        their
                        selected destination. You can quickly notice the recent considerable increase in the number
                        of
                        low-cost airlines. Hence by booking a low-fare calendar international flight, you need to
                        value the
                        airline's budget. The flight price is way lower than you can ever imagine, making them a
                        pocket-friendly choice.

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                To find the Low Fare Calendar, you need to head to the desktop website of the airline (you can search
                for the lowest fares in a calendar view only through the airline's website). The calendar tool will
                help you to compare prices for different days for an entire month. You can also see multiple months
                at once.
                <br>
                It is easy to find prices if you're considering traveling on a different day than you had initially
                planned. In case of travel with fixed dates, the low-fare calendar view will show you the cheapest
                award travel available on your specific travel dates. If you have some flexibility, this tool is an
                ideal option for shopping even more smartly.
