            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <h3>Which days of the week are the most suitable for booking the cheapest flights? </h3>
            <p>So, the best time to buy is generally on Tuesdays or Wednesdays because airlines release their weekly promotions on Monday mornings. </p>
            <h3>What is the best approach to knowing the price of flights and where to find the cheapest flights? </h3>
            <p>You can incorporate <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>faresmatch booking</b></a>, Fare Alerts and fare comparison sites like FaresMatch to track flight prices and get notified of any price drops. </p>
            <h3>Is there a time of the year you could opt for cheaper flights? </h3>
            <p>It is usually observed that airfares are low during other travel times when tourist visits are not as frequent, such as after holidays, from mid-January to mid-March, and from September to early November. Try to travel during off-seasons such as midterms, summer, Christmas, or New Year. </p>
            <h3>Is it better economically to book a round trip than to book two one-way tickets? </h3>
            <p>Yes, paying for a round-trip flight can save you more than booking two different one-way flights. However, it is still advisable to compare both options to select the best offer. </p>
            <h3>Are there any specials or cheaper flights available at the last moment? </h3>
            <p>While shopping around and looking for discounts is still possible, it becomes less so if one waits until the last minute. Airlines generally increase fares nearer the flight time or the day of the flight. When planning is flexible, one or two chances may be there for last-moment bookings; otherwise, it is cheaper to book in advance. </p>
