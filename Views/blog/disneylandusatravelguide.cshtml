                <p class="text-justify">Disneyland Park is a must-see attraction for anybody visiting Southern California on the travel US list. It was the first Disney Park to be created and constructed by Walt Disney himself, and it changed the game for modern theme park design. It is now towards the top of the list of most popular parks in the world, only behind Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in Orlando. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">While making a note to travel US, Disneyland is probably easier to visit than its Florida equivalent, with only two parks and a variety of hotels, most of which are within walking distance. It may be a great addition to your <b>Southern California vacation</b>—or a destination in and of itself. Whether you're stopping by for a day or planning a longer stay, here's everything you need to know to make the most of your trip before <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">flight booking for Disney</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Everything about the parks: </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure are the two theme parks that make up the Disneyland Resort. Spend one day while on a tour to Disneyland Park if you only have one day to visit. Classic rides including Pirates of the Caribbean, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride can be found here. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The Disney California Adventure Park, which lies across the street, is built in a Mission and Art Deco design to depict Southern California in the 1920s when Walt Disney moved there. One of the park's most beautiful features is Cars Land, which is a reproduction of the village from the 2006 cartoon film. Avengers Campus, a zone devoted to Marvel superheroes, is the park's most recent addition. It includes Guardians of the Galaxy Mission: Breakout, a new take on an old favorite that is one of California Adventure's must-see attractions. The previous Tower of Terror at Disneyland has been re-themed as a Marvel movie, with a terrific soundtrack. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">You could take a high-speed ride across the painted desert on Radiator Springs Racers, or climb aboard a tractor on Mater's Junkyard Jamboree, a simple spinning coaster with a soundtrack sung by Larry the Cable Guy that defies logic. Each night around sunset, the neon lights of Radiator Springs glint on to the sound of "Shh-boom," just like in the movie. As the majority of Disneyland's visitors are from the surrounding area, crowds are often reduced when annual pass holders are prohibited from entering, which occurs on many weekends and throughout the summer months. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Before ticket bookings of the Imagine Key or Enchant Key pass, check your travel dates against Disneyland's calendar. An esplanade connects Disneyland's two parks, as well as Downtown Disney, a shopping and dining complex with attractions you wouldn't expect to see at a theme park. For fun at Disney, try activities like boating, playing golf, checking cool rides, etc. You could plan to visit Disneyland in the holiday times to enhance your Disneyland experience 10 times. Try various rides there such as Incredicoaster, Radiator Springs Racers, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and many more to experience fun at Disney. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Consider the following events: </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Throughout the year, Disneyland hosts a variety of annual events. The tour to Disney can take you to the California Adventure Food & Wine Festival that takes place every spring for around two months and includes cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, and over a dozen booths serving appetizer-sized portions of California-inspired cuisine, as well as cocktails, beer, and wine. So, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/faq/how-to-get-cheap-disney-tickets.aspx">flight booking for Disney</a> at these event times will be a sensible thing to do. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">A spectacular parade and goodies like mandarin orange green tea tarts (formed like Mickey, of course) and a winter plum blossom gin mule are part of the Lunar New Year celebrations at Disney California Adventure. The wishing wall, however, is the favorite feature, since it enables guests to leave a message of optimism, health, and happiness for the next year's <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/us-travel-tips-for-beginners.aspx">travel US</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Both parks have a variety of special activities and attractions during the holiday season. Haunted Mansion is a nightmare before Christmas makeover that radically alters the original ride. With a potpourri of festive melodies, It's a Small World receives a unique touch as well. Whatever you do, don't miss the Christmas Fantasy Parade, which marches along Main Street, USA, with its legendary toy soldiers. The holiday parade and fireworks are included with regular park entrances. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Oogie Boogie Bash - A Disney Halloween Party is a special ticketed event held at Disney California Adventure on various nights in September and October (meaning the park will close early to other customers). </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">What hotels should you book? </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, Disneyland Hotel, and Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel are all on-site resort hotels that give guests access to the theme parks one hour before the general public. The Grand Californian even has its entry to Disney California Adventure, allowing guests to skip the security checkpoint and turnstiles, which can be somewhat long. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">There are also a variety of hotels right across the street, many of which are within walking distance of the park entrance or the Anaheim Resort Transportation bus line. On-site is the way to go if you want to maximize your park time or if you're planning a special occasion <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/faq/how-to-get-cheap-disney-world-tickets.aspx">trip to Disneyland</a>. However, many offsite hotels are at least $100 cheaper per night than Disneyland's rooms, so widening your search while travel US will result in big savings. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">What you should know about purchasing tickets? </h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Single-day admission prices range from $104 to $154 for adults and $98 to $146 for children aged three to nine, depending on the time of year and day of the week you visit. Weekdays in January, February, May, and September have the lowest prices; spring break, as well as fall and winter vacations, are the most expensive. The longer you stay and travel US, the cheaper the tickets become, with a five-day admission costing $72 per day and being used over 13 days. You'll also need a park reservation for the same date as well as a parking ticket. You can make reservations up to 120 days in advance and check availability before <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/us-flight-ticket-booking.aspx">ticket bookings</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">It's certainly worth two days at the Disney California parks if you have the time to spend on the travel US list. There are a ton of rides to keep you amused. One can simply roam around and take in the Disney enchantment and attention to detail. If you only have one day, though, this schedule will keep you entertained. If you've ever planned a tour to Disney, you've noticed that there's a lot that goes into making the perfect trip. Just make sure you choose good airline bookings for a smooth journey experience to Disney. </p>
