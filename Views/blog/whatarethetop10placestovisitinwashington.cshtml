            <h3>1. Mount Rainier National Park</h3>
            <p>Mount Rainier National Park, which is centered on the imposing summit of Mount Rainier, the highest mountain in Washington, is located less than an hour's drive outside of Seattle. Though access to certain parts of this amazing park is restricted by snowy conditions, it remains a popular year-round destination. There are fantastic hiking trails and fields of vibrant wildflowers in the park's Paradise area.</p>


            <h3>2. Olympic National Park</h3>
            <p>Olympic National Park is home to some of the greatest activities in Washington State. Situated on the Olympic Peninsula, the park boasts an impressive 922,651 acres of rainforest. The park receives an impressive 100-140 inches of rain annually. The lush splendor that comes with the downpour makes this one of the most gorgeous sites in Washington, so it's worth the risk of getting wet. You may do beachcombing, hiking, camping, and sightseeing very nearby.</p>


            <h3>3. Spokane</h3>
            <p>Located around 300 miles east of Seattle, the second-largest city in the state is quickly becoming one of the top tourist destinations in Washington State.

            <p>One of the most well-known waterfalls in the state is Snoqualmie Falls, which is less than an hour's drive from Seattle. Fortunately, the only drama you're likely to witness is the breathtaking 270-foot falls into the Snoqualmie River, which you may recall from the opening titles of the popular television series Twin Peaks. Enjoy a complete perspective of the falls with just a.5-mile climb separating the upper and lower viewpoint sites.</p>


            <h3>6. San Juan Islands</h3>
            <p>Although San Juan consists of hundreds of islands, both locals and visitors from outside the area appreciate visiting the Orcas Islands, San Juan Island, and Lopez Island. Outdoor activity is a popular attraction on Orcas Island. Go kayaking, reserve a whale-watching boat excursion, or walk up Mount Constitution at Moran State Park. Friday Harbor, a charming seaside hamlet that will win your heart, is a busy community on San Juan Island. Visit Krystal Acres Alpaca Farm to see the largest herd of alpacas in the San Juan Islands, or go whale watching at Lime Kiln Point State Park.</p>

The splendor of this specific location is further enhanced by the Multnomah Falls, which at one point plunge straight into the gorge.</p>


            <h3>8. Lake Chelan</h3>
            <p>Lake Chelan, the Pacific Northwest's center for sightseeing, outdoor activities, and wine tasting, is located at the foot of Washington's North Cascades Mountain Range. One of the main attractions in the area is visiting vineyards, where you can spend a day drinking and taking in the scenery at locations like Mellisoni Vineyards, Karma Vineyards, and Vin du Lac Winery.</p>


            <h3>9. Seattle</h3>
            <p>Seattle, one of the most visited cities in Washington, is a stunning city situated on a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Although Starbucks is the most well-known attraction in Seattle, the largest metropolis in the Pacific Northwest has much more to offer.
