                    <h2>What is a non-stop flight?</h2>
                    <p>A nonstop flight travels nonstop from one airport to another. It’s like a direct flight but it works without changing to other flights. Your flight will take you from your selected departure airport to your desired destination airport without touching the ground. Of course, purchasing a non-stop Flight Ticket to your destination is not always possible, but we can inform you whether one is available and, if not, we can show you the quickest trip available.</p>
                </div>

            <h2>Is there a difference between a direct flight and a non-stop flight?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, there is a distinction between them. Although the term “direct flight” is sometimes used to refer to non-stop flights, the two are vastly different in the airline industry. When booking a flight, keep in mind that a direct flight is any flight that does not change flight numbers between two points. This indicates that your direct flight reservation may be able to make a stop on route to your final destination.
                <br>
                Allowing extra passengers to board and disembark, as well as refueling the plane, may be among the reasons for such stops. What makes nonstop flights less expensive? Customers who desire to fly nonstop can take advantage of nonstop flight deals. Another significant advantage of non-stop plane tickets is that they save a significant amount of time.
