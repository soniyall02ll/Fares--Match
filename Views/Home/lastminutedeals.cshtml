                Years ago, arriving at the airport and requesting a standby ticket was the best method to secure cheap last-minute flight deals. Because there are so many people who travel by air these days, the majority of flights are sold out – and in some cases, overbooked. Moreover, while recent travel restrictions have made going overseas for a long weekend more difficult and anxiety-inducing, the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced travelers' demand for last-minute trips.

            <h3>What does "last-minute travel" imply?</h3>

            <p>The term "last-minute travel" refers to planning a vacation within a few days of departure. Last-minute travel, unlike scheduled excursions, requires embarking on a tour within 14 days of making a last-minute airline reservation. Many people choose to travel without planning ahead of time, and many others are obliged to travel due to unforeseen events. Taking this into account, several OTAs and airlines provide last-minute travel deals, while many hotel properties offer last-minute accommodation deals. People who aren't committed to a specific hotel or even a specific destination will benefit from last-minute travel.</p>

                    <h2>Do airlines offer last-minute flight discounts?</h2>
                    <p>
                        While it is still best to book plane tickets weeks or months in advance, airlines will occasionally offer deals for passengers looking to grab cheap last-minute flight deals with empty seats. Seats on a specific flight to a specific destination may be available for a variety of reasons. Travelers can cancel their tickets up to a few days before takeoff, and public interest in a location can wane.
                        <br>
                        Whatever the reason, airlines know when they won't have enough passengers on a flight to turn a profit and will slash prices to fill the empty seats and make a profit. Of course, travelers have no way of knowing which flights will be discounted until the airlines announce them.
