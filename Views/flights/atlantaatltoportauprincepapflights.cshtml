            <p class="text-justify">Port-au-Prince is one of the most important and most populated cities of Haiti. As the nation’s capital, it is the nation’s administrative centre and houses the Presidential Palace, which is the seat of all executive power in the state. Due to a devastating earthquake that10, the National Palace was damaged beyond repair. This area was once the home of the Taíno people and many of their settlements, including the Bohoma and Guahaba. This area was also the location of an important city of the Xaragua chiefdom known as Yaguana. This predominance of the Taíno ended with the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The first white colonists to settle in this area arrived in the fifteenth century. After decades of subjecting the indigenous people to violence, the Spanish finally secured control of the area. However, the harbour of Port-Au-Prince, extremely valuable to all powers vying for control of the area, only attracted the attention of foreign powers’ attention until the Spanish were finally forced to give up control. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The area then came under the control of French pirates, who proved too difficult for the government in Paris to control. Even Dutch merchants sought shelter from time to time. Slowly but surely, Haiti gained independence from foreign powers.
