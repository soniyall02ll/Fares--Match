            <p class="text-justify">Iceland, a volcanic island in Europe, is known for its volcanic origin and vast glacial fields. The sparsely populated island lets you enjoy the true beauty of the Arctic landscape. Located in the Arctic Ocean, the island lets you escape from your daily life into the chilling yet stunning snow. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The island is greatly dependent on its tourism industry. Having greatly benefitted from the large number of tourists who visit its shores, the nation has become highly developed and offers all modern resources and amenities to tourists. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The Althing governs Iceland – the first and longest continuing of all parliaments in the world. The Althingisishúsid, the current Icelandic parliament building, is a fantastic example of nineteenth-century Icelandic traditional architecture. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Other examples of distinct Icelandic architecture include the Hallgrímskirkja, the famous church which has become intricately entwined with Iceland's national identity. The Safnahusid houses many important parts of Icelandic culture, including the Poetic Edda and many Islendingasögur. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Lakes and fjords dot the Icelandic landscape, including the major lakes of Thórisvatn, Thingvallavatn and Jökulsárlón. Geysir and Strokkur are famous geysers on the island. Both dormant and active volcanoes include Hekla, Eldgjá, Grímsvôtn and Laki. </p>
