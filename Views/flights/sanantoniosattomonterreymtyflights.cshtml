            <h3>Planning the Perfect time to Visit</h3>

            <p>The best time for travelers to visit Monterey is during the fall season which is September to November. This season consists of sunny days in the 60s and 70s (°F) with lower tourism compared to summer. The beaches are serene making it perfect for kayaking or watching whales and adding flavor to the playground are events such as the Monterey Wine Festival. Another good time to go is Spring (March to May) as there are nice wildflowers and migrating gray whales added to the scenery. Summer comes in packed full of holidays and/or events and adventures outdoors although the weather is a bit warmer. Winter is the most serene time that is excellent for indoor recreation and whale watching. To be honest, each season has some kind of magic.</p>
