            <h2>SAS Airlines Refund Policy</h2>

            <p>Scandinavian Airlines is the European subcontinent's largest airline. It is the flag airline of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. It serves 180 locations across Europe, Asia, and North America in 35 countries. </p>

            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>

            <p>The amount of the refund will be determined by the ticket restrictions. Service fees and <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/sas-airlines-refund-policy.aspx">flight cancellation</a> costs are not refundable. </p>

            <p>The money is repaid in the same way it was paid when you purchased the ticket, less any travel extras. If SAS cancels your flight, you will be refunded in full, including service costs, cancellation fees, and travel extras. </p>

            <h2>FAQs</h2>

            <h3>How can I cancel my flight ticket with SAS Airlines? </h3>

            <p>You can cancel your SAS Airlines flight by following the instructions in the confirmation email or on our website. Contact SAS Customer Service if you need to cancel more than 24 hours following your reservation. If you are eligible for a refund, it will be applied to the card you used to make the purchase. You can get a full refund if you book on our website within 24 hours after making your reservation. You can receive a refund up to 12 hours before departure if you bought your ticket less than 24 hours before departure. </p>

            <h3>When can I request a refund? When can I expect it? </h3>

            <p>All tickets may be canceled and fully refunded within 24 hours from the time of purchase. After the withdrawal request is approved, the reimbursement takes 7 to 20 working days to process. Returns will be made using the same method of payment. </p>

            <h3>Can I ask for compensation if my flight gets delayed by 2 hours? </h3>

            <p>All you have to do now is submit a claim for reimbursement. Even a two-hour flight delay may be enough to entitle you to compensation in the end. But SAS promises to compensate passengers in the event of delays of more than 3 hours, cancellations, or denial of boardings due to overbooking. Compensation for 1,500 km is 250 EUR, for between 1,500 and 3,500 km is 400, and for more than 3,500 kilometres, you will be compensated with 600 EUR. </p>

            <h3>How to check if my flight is refundable? </h3>

            <p>There are situations when we need to postpone a ticket but also wish to return to avoid any inconvenience. We are frequently concerned about SAS Airlines' ability to provide refunds. We need to know everything there is to know about SAS Airlines' refund policies. The concept of receiving a full refund on the initial form if we cancel our flight within 24 hours of booking is a recent facility. </p>

            <h3>What is the best way to see if my SAS airline is refundable? </h3>

            <p>Read all of the terms and conditions in the refund section of the SAS airline service to see if it offers a full refund or a partial refund. If the airlines give partial refunds, you might look for full refundable flight tickets. </p>
