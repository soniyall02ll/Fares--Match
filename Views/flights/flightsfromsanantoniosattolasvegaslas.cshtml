            <h2>The ideal time to plan your trip from San Antonio to Las Vegas</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">In the middle of the desert, Las Vegas is a haven of luxury. The city's allure is seductive, and the Strip glistens with promise. But you may be looking for the best time to visit it if you want to know if it's constantly sweltering hot in the desert or if going during the off-season will get you a better deal. In the spring and fall, Las Vegas is nice during the day and delightfully cool at night. Although April through June and September through November are almost ideal, March is arguably the busiest month. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">However, the high season does bring exorbitant accommodation and ticket costs. The ideal times to visit Las Vegas to avoid crowds are in the winter and summer, while spring and fall tend to draw the largest numbers of tourists. However, these off-seasons offer more tolerable crowds compared to the rest of the year. Try travelling in the winter shoulder season to find the ideal balance between cost and climate. Summer is another off-peak season, although if you're not used to the heat or dehydrated, it might be risky to stroll the Strip in triple digits.</p>
