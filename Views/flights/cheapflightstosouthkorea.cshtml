            <h4>Before going to South Korea, keep the following in mind</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Flying in Seoul is advantageous for those planning to visit the North Korean border. The bulk of international <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights.aspx">flights</a> between South Korea and the United States fly through Seoul, bringing you near to the demilitarized zone (DMZ). The Demilitarized Zone can be reached directly from Seoul via the official DMZ Peace Train. </li>

                <li>Although some hotels in South Korea accept US dollars, you may typically get a better deal by paying in the local currency, the South Korean Won. Most shops take Visa and Mastercard, but having cash on hand for street vendors and other situations where cards aren't accepted is a good idea. </li>

                <li>
                    Flying into Daegu can be convenient if you're seeking a city with easy access to the rest of South Korea. Daegu is not only a popular tourist destination and a large South Korean metropolis, but it is also centrally positioned.
                </li>
                <li>There are multiple <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-south-korea.aspx">nonstop flights to South Korea</a> from major US cities such as San Francisco, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, and others, but solely to Seoul. Flying from the United States to other parts of Korea will require at least one stop, with Seoul, Taipei, and Hong Kong being popular layover cities. </li>

                <li>Jeju Island is one of South Korea's most popular tourist sites outside of the major cities, and there are various ways to get there. You can fly to Jeju from the United States, with a stopover in Taipei or Seoul, or fly to Busan and take the ferry the rest of the way. </li>
            </ul>
