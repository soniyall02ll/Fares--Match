            <h2>Perfect time to plan for a weekend getaway in Kansas City</h2>

Even though most of the tourists visit the city during the summer months, people from June to August, the city remains rather vacant. For those who cannot stand heat, and those who cannot stand cold, the best seasons would be, respectively, early spring- May, and early autumn –October as conditions are not extreme, but it is still nice to enjoy outdoor public parks and gardens. On the other hand, the summer is supposed to be peaceful and bright if one isn't bothered by the heat. This is the time when the yearly International Jazz Festival comes into town. On the other hand, winter can be associated with wide ice rinks and beautiful snowfall; But as a true winter lover, November to December is the best time when you can feel the flavor of the winter season.</p>
