                <h3>Best and the Worst months to book Southwest flights for travel deals</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">After various studies, it is found that the cheapest Southwest <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">flight deals and offers</a> are between three months and 30 days in advance.
