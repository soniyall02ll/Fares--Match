            <h2>Chicago Hotels</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">If you travel a lot, staying at good hotels becomes a top priority. It is a second home when away from you're away from home, and it is important to choose one wisely. Hotels can greatly impact your stay experience for business trips, solo trips, or even family trips. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Whatever the reason, when you travel often, you get pickier about everything from the quality of rooms to the views that your room comes with. Here are a few things to consider when <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/hotel-search/chicago-hotels.aspx">finding hotels</a> that are meant just for you, catering to all your needs. </p>

            <strong>Hygiene</strong>
            <p class="text-justify">We cannot say this enough! Emphasise on hotels that provide you with excellent hygiene services even if the rooms are smaller. You do not want to get back home tired and lousy to find your room smelly with damp and leaky walls and gross washrooms. Look for actual pictures of the hotel rooms on their sites, Facebook pages, and Google. This way, you can find <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">hotel reservations</a> that best suit your needs. </p>

            <strong>Friendly Hotel Staff</strong>
            <p class="text-justify">We all panic when in an absolutely strange and unknown place, and mishaps always happen no matter how good you are at avoiding them. What matters most is having friendly, smiley faces around you to make you feel better and feel at home. Always look for hotel reviews to find out if the staff is friendly and the services of a hotel are good. They are the best way to go about your research for online hotel booking in the right way. </p>

            <h3>Select Hotels with Multiple Dining options</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">To relish more food options, you should look for hotels offering in-restaurant food services like dining areas, cafés, and more. This way, you may have to look around for food less and can have meals served to you either in your room or eat in the dining area. Look for hotels offering these hotel deals through their <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/hotels.aspx">hotel booking</a> sites to find hotel deals that come in a package and offer the best deals. </p>

            <h4>Check out the Size of the Rooms</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Before proceeding with your hotel reservation, checking the size of the rooms solely depends on how many people you're traveling with. If it is a solo trip, you can go for rooms that are sized small but are big enough to accommodate one person comfortably. However, if you're planning to travel with family and opt to share one room or book two rooms, you may want to look at the size of the rooms. You can do so by referring to the original hotel website or calling the hotel and asking them to provide you with pictures of the room to confirm thoroughly. </p>

            <h4>Amenities for Children</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">When traveling with family, this is one important factor you should always consider. You want to look for hotels that are child friendly and that come with many amenities for children, such as play areas, swimming pools for children, a common room for kids, and much more. By choosing a child-friendly hotel, you can rest assured that your child is within safe parameters even when away from your sight. </p>

            <h4>Check Hotel Reviews</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">Hotel reviews are one big perk for someone sitting miles away from the hotel and finally needing information to make their reservation. Reviews help you decide if the hotel's services and staff are friendly and good enough for you to spend your money on them. Reviews are a great source to get an inside view of the hotel and its amenities. Therefore, always read reviews to be one hundred percent sure of your choice of hotel. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">With these few pointers checked, you can rest a little knowing your basic needs are met and thus proceed with your hotel reservation or research further to find <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">cheap hotels</a> or hotel deals if you book last minute. The choice is yours. However, always make sure to look for basic amenities before proceeding to check out other things of less importance. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">You can also refer to FaresMatch, a leading online portal for <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">booking flight tickets</a> that gets you exclusive access to great flight deals at a discounted price.
