                <h2>Flight Charges and Cost Insights </h2>

                    <li>The last-minute flight prices may differ to a greater or lesser degree along the route, time of booking, number of seats available, etc. </li>
                    <li>Air New Zealand finds itself in the auspicious pricing zone as well, with one-way tickets going for as low as 150 dollars for domestic flights and approximately 500 dollars for international flights. </li>

                </ul>

                <h2>When to Visit New Zealand? </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Air New Zealand international flights</b> are best purchased about 3 to 6 months beforehand for more inexpensive fares and good seat availability. </li>
                    <li>Booking early benefits the traveller with lower fares, especially for long-haul destinations such as New Zealand, the islands of the Pacific region, and others. </li>
                    <li>If you find it imperative to travel during peak seasons (Christmas or New Year or school holidays), then it is best for you to start searching 6 months in advance of the chosen time frame. </li>
                    <li>For example, for domestic flights to New Zealand and perhaps the closest East Coast cities in Australia or Pacific islands, 1- to 2-month purchase duration is usually more than enough to get good rates. </li>
                    <li>Always search for cheap tickets or promotional offers, which, if the traveller is considerate with traveling dates, much cheaper options are available. </li>
                </ul>
