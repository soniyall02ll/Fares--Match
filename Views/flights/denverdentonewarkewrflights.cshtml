            <h2>Gateway to New York's Pulse: Newark</h2>
            <p>Newark, New Jersey, often is foregone by the sprawling metropolis that lies next door—New York City. But this city has its own endearing and ever-pleasing character. Newark has been established as one of the oldest cities in America and is endowed with a rich cultural heritage, an arts scene that is buzzing, and a historic mix of materials. Just a stone's throw from Manhattan, Newark is the ideal place for walking the two rivers. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the Art Museum, which is one of the largest in the state. Try ethnic fare in the Ironbound District; Portuguese and Brazilian restaurants make it the smaller heaven for food lovers. For music, Prudential Centre is the primary venue for concerts and sporting events.</li>
                <li>Newark carries its distinctive vibe despite being almost right beside New York. The well-preserved historic buildings, the quaint little cafes, and the local businesses speak an East Coast experience through and through.</li>
