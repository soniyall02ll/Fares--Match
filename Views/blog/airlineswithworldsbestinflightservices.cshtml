                <p class="text-justify">The mode of transport through the air is generally not as much used as the other modes of transport related to land. As you might know, trains, buses, and the metro see more passengers than any airplane. There are many reasons for it, some of which might be directly linked with the other modes of transport, and some might be related to the price. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">It is common sense that most of the country's people won't have to travel from state to state or country to country, which is why we often see more people in buses or metros. The next factor is the price and complications generally involved with flights. Generally, people traveling in flight aim to go from one state to another or a country to another due to many complications such as visa, passport, and many more. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">But the thing that upsets most the people is its price, as traveling from state to state by a flight might cost 3 times more than traveling by train. And if you are considering traveling from one country to another, it will be a pricey deal. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">But recent times have seen people change their minds about flight and airplanes. Airlines and airplane companies have started cutting off their flight ticket prices. This step revolutionized the flight industry as more and more people shifted to airplanes for state-to-state travel. This change was coming as all major airlines understood that their sales were not increasing, and the main obstacle was their pricing. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">What are in-flight services, and why are they so important? </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Generally, <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/airlines-with-worlds-best-in-flight-services.aspx">in-flight services</a> are the additional facilities that the airlines offer you other than the travel from one place to other. These services were not that important in the previous decades, but after the airlines normalized the inclusion of extra facilities with their flights, it became a necessity for the passengers. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Due to this, if they don't find the services top-notch, it could certainly dissatisfy them, which is the last thing that any airline would want. Some of the important in-flight services for the passengers are mentioned below- </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Free Wi-Fi</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">It is one of the most basic and important in-flight services that every airline should offer its customers. Traveling from country to country can take a long time, and, in that time, you need a Wi-Fi connection to keep you connected. As you should know, your data connection from your sim card won't work during flights, due to which you will need the help of a Wi-Fi to keep yourself entertained during the flight. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">Source of entertainment</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">This is the continuation of the last point as you need Wi-Fi to pass your time and keep you entertained. But this would not be possible if you didn't have a way of enjoying the content. The in-flight services come into a clutch, as most of them provide a small smart television in front of their respective seats along with headphones. The television is already connected to Wi-Fi, so you can enjoy movies and shows. </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Food and beverages</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Food and beverages are one of the most basic services every airline must provide their customers/passengers. Although it is a basic service, it can potentially upset the passengers the most if not done correctly. Usually, the biggest airlines provide multi-cuisine food and beverages, which can be paid for and bought by the passengers or included with the flight ticket. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">These are some of the things that you must consider before you <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/jetblue-book-a-flight.aspx">book a flight</a>. Enough of talks about in-flight services now. Let's know about some of the most well-known airlines that provide their customers with the best in-flight services. Some of these airlines are mentioned below- </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Emirates Airlines </h3>

                <p class="text-justify">It is one of the world's largest and most well-reputed airlines. They draw their origins from UAE (United Arab Emirates), a subsidiary brand of The Emirates Group. They are known for their best-in-class flight services. If we are talking of in-flight services, the first thing that comes to mind is Wi-Fi. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">You will pay a small fee for the high-quality Wi-Fi, with which you can surf the internet without buffer and lag. World-class dining is one of their specialties as they provide multi-cuisine and veg and non-veg food for their customers. The lounge of Emirates Airways is the most luxurious among all the airlines with a personal cater system where you can eat anything you want without any extra charge. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you have any doubts regarding the entertainment system, don’t worry; they also provide you with a television in front of every passenger's seat. You can get access to over 5000 channels of movies, shows, music, and more. If you are ready to spend a lot of money to travel in the most comfortable way possible, then Emirates is the way to go. </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">Singapore Airlines</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Just like Emirates Airlines, Singapore Airlines is also one of the largest airlines in the entire world. They draw their origins from the Asian country of Singapore. They are one of the oldest airlines that have maintained their spot as one of the largest airlines in the world. For your entertainment, you will get television in front of your seat, in which you can play games through the web, read web novels and watch many shows and movies. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">You also get high-speed Wi-Fi connectivity with which you can surf the internet seamlessly. If you have booked the premium class <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">plane tickets</a> of this airline, you can pre-select your food, but if you have booked a base ticket, you will also get access to the delicious, fresh, and multi-cuisine food and beverages served by caterers. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Due to flight tickets being cheaper than ever, people have started to choose flights over train journeys. Due to this, people have set high standards and expectations from the services of the airlines, but if they fail to meet them, it can cause customer dissatisfaction. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you have the money to spend on a luxurious flight, you should always research before <b>flight booking</b> as it might be costlier than the base <b>cheap tickets</b>. Many websites occasionally provide you with good <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">airfare deals</a>, so doing research is a must. </p>
