                <p class="text-justify">Every COVID-19 vaccine has its own set of reasons for receiving the vaccine. You or someone you care about may have a compromised immune system, or you may simply despise the thought of being very ill for an extended period. However, after months of remaining at home, every traveler is likely to be motivated by the prospect of once again being able to travel safely. Now that international air traveling is steadily reopening, vaccination not only gives you peace of mind for your health, but it's also allowing you to visit countries you wouldn't have been allowed to visit before. Hence, in this post, you will be exposed to those places you can travel to, now. Bringing to you some of the world's most popular tourist spots that require vaccination to enter are:</p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Belize</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">All overseas arrivals, regardless of immunization status, must now submit a negative Covid-19 test, according to Belize's most recent travel requirements. A negative COVID-19 PCR test, or a negative result from any authorized Antigen Rapid Test, must be performed within 96 hours after travel. Those who do not meet the requirements will be tested at the airport for a cost of USD 50 per person. Travelers who have been fully vaccinated must have gotten their final dosage at least two weeks before arriving in Belize. They must also download its Health App and fill out the necessary health information 72 hours before arriving. All international travelers will be required to show proof of having purchased travel health insurance starting February 15, 2022. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Cayman Island</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Vaccinated travelers can visit the Cayman Islands without having to go through quarantine. The Caribbean nation has reached the fourth stage of its reopening plan, which allows vaccinated visitors from countries where at least 60% of the population has gotten one dosage of the vaccine to freely travel across the islands (the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. fit those criteria). Travelers who have been vaccinated must obtain a certificate to travel, have a negative PCR test within 72 hours after departure, have COVID-19 safety-specific medical and travel insurance, and take a fast test on the second, fifth, and tenth days of their stay. Unvaccinated visitors are not permitted on the islands unless they have a close family connection, own property, or operate a business. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Canada</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Foreign nationals who are fully immunized are permitted to enter Canada. All arrivals must submit their travel details, including quarantine plans and contact information, to ArriveCAN 72 hours before their arrival. Travelers arriving from the air border may be tested again upon arrival and self-isolated until getting back the results. Arrivals from the USA are exempt. Passengers to Canada (who didn’t come from Canada or the United States) are likely to be tested upon arrival and required to quarantine in an approved hotel, until results are available, at their own expense. Domestic passengers must also self-quarantine upon arrival in some provinces in Canada. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Cyprus</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">After obtaining a Cyprus <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights.aspx">Flight</a> Pass, it is possible to travel to Cyprus from the EU, Schengen, and authorized nations. All visitors to Cyprus must have a negative PCR test within the last 72 hours or an antigen test within the last 24 hours, and they must be tested upon arrival regardless of vaccination status, and they must self-isolate until the findings are received. However, those who have received a COVID-19 booster dose are exempt from the testing criteria. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Fiji</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Began with Dec. 1, Fiji, which consists of over 300 islands in the South Pacific, reopened its borders to vaccinated visitors. The United States is a "travel partner" country for Fiji, which means tourists do not have to go through quarantine (nonetheless, visitors from non-travel partner countries must quarantine for 10 nights). All travelers must present a negative PCR test result obtained within 72 hours of departure, evidence of full vaccination, and proof of at least three nights of paid lodging at an approved hotel or resort. They must also have COVID-19-specific medical travel insurance and submit to a quick test 48 hours after checking into their accommodation. Travel to Fiji is currently prohibited for those who have not been vaccinated. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Finland</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Finland has officially opened its doors to fully vaccinated visitors from low-risk countries. Vaccination Passports must be shown upon arrival and must show that they received their final vaccine 14 days before arriving in Finland. Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, CoronaVac, and Sinopharm have all had COVID-19 vaccines approved for entrance so far. A negative PCR or Antigen test, no older than 48 hours, is necessary for all visitors to Finland. Arrivals from the EU and Schengen nations having a recent negative PCR test must also be tested within 3 to 5 days of receiving them. Those who have been vaccinated and who have recovered from COVID-19 do not need to be tested. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">France</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">A negative PCR or antigen test result is required for anyone coming to France from outside the EU. Vaccinated persons must be no more than 48 hours old at the time of departure, and unvaccinated individuals must be no more than 24 hours old. Travelers, who have been fully vaccinated, however, are exempt from the testing procedures. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Hongkong</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Some international travelers can visit <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/hong-kong-airlines.aspx">Hong Kong</a>. Foreign visitors traveling from Mainland China, Macao, or Taiwan are permitted to enter Hong Kong unless they have visited any other countries in the previous 14 days. Arrivals from other countries who have been vaccinated may also enter unless they are from high-risk countries. Nonresidents and unvaccinated residents are prohibited from air traveling to high-risk countries. A health statement will be needed for anyone entering Hong Kong. All newcomers must submit negative COVID-19 test results that are no more than 48 hours old and be tested during their quarantine period. All newcomers will be tested upon arrival, daily for the first seven days, and on days 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 of their stay. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">India</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">If you hold a tourist visa or an e-visa, you can enter India, but you must fill out a form before you arrive. All arrivals must submit a negative RT-PCR test to India's Air Suvidha site within 72 hours of their arrival. However, fully vaccinated travelers are free from the pre-testing. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Panama</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Panama's international <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">flight booking</a> has resumed. Before arriving, all approved visitors will be required to complete a travel declaration form. Please note that only arrivals who have gotten a booster dose are considered fully vaccinated. Anyone entering Panama will be asked to show proof of a negative antigen or PCR test taken within the last 72 hours. Both tests must be carried out in a laboratory. It is also possible to get tested upon arrival for a fee of USD 50; tourists who have been vaccinated are exempt. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Philippines</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Travelers from non-visa-required nations are welcome to visit the Philippines if they are fully vaccinated.

All visitors to the Philippines must show proof of vaccination and a negative RT-PCR test within 48 hours of arrival. Vaccinated visitors are exempt from quarantine. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">Spain</h2>

Before arriving, all visitors must complete an FCS form. All visitors to Spain will be asked to complete a health control form, which will include a PCR test that is no more than 72 hours old, an antigen test that is no more than 24 hours old, and confirmation of vaccination. Both tests must be carried out in a laboratory. Exemptions apply to visitors from nations deemed to be safe. </p>

                <h2 class="text-justify">United Kingdom</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">The British government has allowed vaccinated Americans to enter the UK without having to undergo an obligatory quarantine. Fully vaccinated Americans that are air traveling in the United Kingdom must submit a pre-departure negative COVID-19 test and will be required to take a PCR test on day two after arrival. Those who were vaccinated in the United States will also need to show proof of residency in the United States. Children under the age of 11 are excluded from the United Kingdom's foreign arrivals testing requirements. </p>
