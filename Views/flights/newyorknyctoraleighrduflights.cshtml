            <h2>When to book</h2>
            <p>When it comes to getting the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-raleigh.aspx"><b>cheapest flights to Raleigh</b></a>, you should book your ticket three weeks to three months in advance. For domestic flights, one should book his/her flight tickets a month before his/her travel, whereas for international travel, four to six weeks is sufficient. It is evident that airline ticket costs increase nearer to the date of the flight; therefore, booking earlier goes a long way. Also, do not book flights on the weekends as the prices are always higher than those on the weekdays. </p>
