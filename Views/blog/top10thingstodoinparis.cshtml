                <h2>1. For sunset at the Montmartre Sacred Heart Basilica</h2>
                <p>For that fully romantic experience, go to the Sacre-Coeur Basilica, located on top of the Montmartre hill of Paris.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This relatively high location not only offers a sweeping view of the city from down below but also makes it particularly breathtaking at sunset.

                    <li>Imagine that the basilica is calm by its sounds and cradled by the almost bohemian atmosphere of the Montmartre neighbourhood making it an ideal place for very romantic couples. </li>
                    <li>Afterwards, to keep the romance alive in one of the most picturesque districts in Paris, explore its small streets full of cafés and art studios.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. The Picnic by the Seine River</h2>
