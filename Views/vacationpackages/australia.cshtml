            <h2>A City Harbour With a Life of Its Own</h2>
            <p>Possibly the first city to be visited in Australia, and for good reasons too. Sydney's harbour, along with the iconic red sails of the Opera House and Bondi Beach, are attributes of urban excitement meshed with coastal charm. Aside from sightseeing, Sydney offers fine dining options, tight nightlife, and ferry rides to hidden coves.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, Sydney holiday packages include guided tours, dinner cruises on the harbour, and admission to various local attractions. Australia feels right for sunrise surfing or sunset strolls through Darling Harbour.</p>

                    <h2>Australia’s Underwater Paradise</h2>
                    <p>The Great Barrier Reef, extending for over 1,400 miles, this UNESCO World Heritage site tempts you to snorkel, scuba dive, or partake in scenic flights to get a bird's eye view of the colourful marine life.</p>
                    <p>There are several all-inclusive Aussie vacation packages that offer eco-lodges or resorts with reef access, plus guided underwater excursions. Visiting this natural wonder is a one-time opportunity that truly depicts the splendour and biodiversity of Australia.</p>

            <p><b>Australia vacation packages with airfare</b> will often include guided food tours, entry to key museums, and centrally located hotel stays. The city's events range from music festivals to the Australian Open tennis, creating an exciting ambience all year round.</p>

            <h2>Adventure and Wildlife Tours in Australia</h2>
            <p>Abundant in Australia, the adventures for outdoor devotees include, but are not limited to, kangaroo encounters on Kangaroo Island, hiking in the Blue Mountains, or an exciting surfing experience in Byron Bay. On many expeditions, you will be hosted in a wildlife-friendly manner, stay in eco-lodges, and get a nature guide who will allow you to really get the feel of Australia in terms of wildlife and nature.</p>
