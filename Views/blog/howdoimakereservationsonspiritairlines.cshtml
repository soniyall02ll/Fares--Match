                <p class="text-justify">If you are choosing Spirit airlines to fly to a range of destinations in Central and South America and the USA, there are certain things you must know to get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">cheap airplane tickets</a>. The fares advertised on the official website often sound too good to be true. However, most of the time, they are full of hidden fees and extra charges. Hence below are some hacks and tricks that can be applied to get the best airfare deals on Spirit Airlines. </p>

                <h2>Some hacks to save on Spirit Airlines</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Below are some tricks and tips that are going to help you grab <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">cheap flight deals on Spirit Airlines</a>-</p>


                <p class="text-justify">
                    <strong>Booking at least two weeks in advance</strong>
                    It is always advised that booking a flight in advance is always going to save you a lot of money. If you book a flight too close to the departure date, you will likely pay higher airfare.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    <strong>Booking through the official website</strong>
                    Always book flights only online at spirit.com and not on the phone through any other website. The reason is you will typically see extra fees when you navigate away from their website. However, you can use various flight finder apps to compare fares and choose the best one.
                </p>


                <p class="text-justify">
                    <strong>Apply coupon to your flight purchase</strong>
                    Sometimes using a coupon can be challenging, given all the restrictions. However, it's worth trying it. The coupons offered by Spirit Airlines can be seen through their email newsletter, which is given frequently. You can also check them on their homepage.
                </p>


                <p class="text-justify">
                    <strong>Pack your luggage light</strong>
                    The baggage fees of the airline can end up adding more costs. Hence you will end up making your once cheap flight into an expensive journey. If you have extra baggage, it is best to purchase it before check-in, or you can even fly on a different airline with more liberal baggage rules.
