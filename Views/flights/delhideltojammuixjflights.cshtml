            <h3>Top Five Hidden Gems in Jammu</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Sanasar:</b> This lowland is surrounded by evergreen mountain ranges in which nature lovers can find excitement and amazing sights, including paragliding among others.</li>
                <li><b>Mansar Lake:</b> Sometimes, it appears an isolated lake near which mindfulness has invaded over time, and this makes picnicking pretty disclosed, but boating remains frequent.</li>
                <li><b>Nubra Valley:</b> This is a site of beautiful scenery and rare sand hills, presenting an entirely new range of tourism possibilities.</li>
                <li><b>Buddha Amarnath Temple:</b> Situated in a tranquil setting, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is little known as a pilgrimage place. It has a whole bunch of faithful travellers who come here as their belief requires.</li>
                <li><b>Bhaderwah:</b> Possessing older temples, thick valleys as well as lively people, Bhaderwah is therefore regarded as "Mini Kashmir" where exploration off the main track is possible.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>A Sample Travel Plan</h4>
