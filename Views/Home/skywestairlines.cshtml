            <h2>Traveling with Pets: </h2>

            <p>When possible, SkyWest Airlines will transport your pet. SkyWest imposes the following additional limits in addition to the partners' programs due to equipment size or other operational constraints. Kennels must fit under the seat and must be kept in the kennel at the airport, during boarding/deplaning, and throughout the flight. The pet is not permitted to purchase seats. </p>

            <p>The maximum kennel size approved for pets as checked baggage is one large kennel or two small or medium kennels per trip. Extra-large or enormous kennels are not accepted by the airline. SkyWest Airlines booking must be made in advance. </p>

            <h3>Best time to fly with SkyWest Airlines</h3>

            <p>Every airport and region has its own set of days and times when fewer people fly in and out, resulting in a larger surplus of available seats with lower demand, allowing airlines to charge less. There's also seasonal and holiday travel, which increases demand and reduces the chances of getting the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com">best fare deal</a>. </p>

            <p>However, you may save money on low-cost SkyWest Airlines tickets by following a simple pattern in how most people travel. Ticket prices are frequently higher during the peak tourist season of any venue. The off-season is the greatest time to go because you may get a cheaper SkyWest ticket, but you must make sure the weather is suitable for the trip. </p>
