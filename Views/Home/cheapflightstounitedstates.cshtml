            <h2>Best time to Book Flight Ticket to the US</h2>
            <p>The price of tickets to any place depends a lot on the traffic of tourists visiting the website and booking sites of the airlines. The same goes for tickets to the USA. The best time to <strong>book a flight to the USA</strong> is on weekdays. On weekdays, most people are busy with their daily schedule, and during the rush hour, no one is going to plan for a vacation; that is done mostly on weekends. </p>

            <p>Hence, customers' traffic on the airlines' websites is quite low, which makes them lower their prices for the better sale of tickets. Also, the available tickets are abundant due to a lack of customers. </p>


            <h3>Popular Airports in the US</h3>
            <p>Airports often make a big impact when choosing the proper flight tickets. Busy and popular airports have a lot of traffic and hence are much more developed in terms of service and amenities. The number of fights taking off is also more. </p>

            <p><strong>Los Angeles International: </strong>Famous for its attraction towards celebrities and rich people, this airport often serves some of the most well-known faces in the film industry. Their private jets and aircraft often land at this airport, the second busiest airport in the USA. </p>
            <p><strong>O’Hare International Airport (ORD) </strong>: Being the third busiest airport in the United States, it has a legacy of its own; it was built during WWII when it served as an aircraft manufacturing base and was later commercially opened to the public as an airport. </p>
            <p><strong>Dallas/Fort worth International Airport (DFW) </strong>: This airport is nothing less than a city with its police department, zip code, and emergency medical services. </p>
            <p><strong>Denver International Airport </strong>: The fifth busiest airport, situated in Denver, serves millions of passengers annually and has a huge area of 34000 acres. It has a staggering number of 24 airlines that fly to over 200 destinations. </p>

            <h3>Cheap Flight Deals for US</h3>
            <p>Good airlines often offer their customers good deals on flights and ticket sales. They also make reservations easier; hence, choosing the right airlines is the first choice for grabbing the best deals. </p>
