            <p class="text-justify">Charleston is a city that lies at the confluence of three rivers – the Ashley, the Wando, and the Cooper. Although the Cusabo tribe had settled there for centuries, white settlers took control in the seventeenth century. The settlement was named after the British King Charles 2 of the Stuart dynasty. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">The city preserves its history through buildings that have been kept unchanged, such as the Dock Street Theatre, the Aiken-Rhett House, and the Calhoun Mansion. The Charleston Museum is another favourite spot to visit among history lovers. The Gibbes Museum of Art is a spot that lovers of history and art can enjoy. A famous tourist attraction of this city is the pastel houses of Rainbow Row. On any dull day, stroll along this road to colour your imagination. The city also houses the Waterfront Park, a favourite leisure spot among tourists and locals. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Once famous as a point for enslaved person trade, the city has since redeemed itself. It is home to multiple institutions celebrating African American culture, such as the International African American Museum, Old Slave Mart Museum and Avery Research Centre for African American History and Culture. Other spots of interest include the spectacularly built South Carolina Aquarium and the historical Fireproof Building. The best way to get <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/"><b>cheap flights</b></a> to Charleston is by getting tickets in advance and opting for times when business might be slower for airlines. Travellers are advised to remain open to multiple dates of arrival and departure. That way, finding a flight that suits their schedule becomes more easily accessible. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">In case there is a tight schedule, it always helps to keep an eye out for family or couple deals, discounts, and offers that can be provided by the airlines, which help considerably in further reducing the cost of travel. Aiming for holidays and weekends, with special offers, might also be a good idea. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">If something else works out due to some inflexible prior engagement, opt for the help of apps and websites that can pick out cheap deals and offers for any given moment. </p>
