                <p class="text-justify">Regarding weekend getaways and short stays, the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights/cheap-flights-to-united-kingdom.aspx">United Kingdom</a> is one of the best in Europe. Comprising England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the UK has a lot to offer through short trips. With its rich heritage, this country of monarchs has prosperous cities and some remarkable natural retreats for adventurers! Below are some of the best getaways in the UK. </p>

                <h2>The best 9 getaways in the UK</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">The UK has some of the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/best-getaways-in-the-united-kingdom.aspx">best tourist spots in Europe</a>. Here are some of the best places to visit and re-energize the spirit: </p>

                <h3>Isle of Skye, Scotland</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Scotland, a constituent county of the UK, is famous for its rocky cliffs and beautiful islands, but none among them surpasses in beauty the Isle of Skye. The landscape of Skye is craggy, overpowered by the Cuillin Mountains. The island is deserted, but its rich culture can be seen everywhere—a restaurant, the Three Chimneys, which is now famous for its international visitors.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Weekend stays on the Island of Skye: weekenders visiting the Isle of Skye may find The Black Shed, a cheap weekend getaway, very affordable and fun. The Black Shed is one of the most prominent log cabins in the UK. Kinloch Lodge is another excellent option with its 16th-century paintings, but it is slightly expensive. </p>

                <h3>Cotswold, England</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Cotswold is the ideal weekend getaway for city folks. Although it is a little more crowded than Skye, Cotswold is an excellent place to breathe fresh air. Cotswold has several antique shops for the hobbyists visiting the place; there are pubs and historic houses, all of which have something to say about England's rural life. The place has some of the most beautiful gardens to visit in the spring. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Weekend stays in the Cotswolds: Airbnbs in the UK are a thing, and more so in the rural backdrops of the Cotswolds. However, living like a local may not be the most practical option. Gloucestershire major house is a bed and breakfast option which can accommodate up to thirty-six people. Thyme in Southrop is also another weekend stay option in the Cotswolds. </p>
                <h3>Wye Valley, England, and Wales</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Wye Valley is located on the border between England and Wales. This valley has several beautiful towns to stay in on weekends, bank by the river Wye. The most happening of these places is the Hay-on-Wye village, which is famous for its literary festival celebrated annually. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Weekend getaways in Wye valley: as with any rural destination, Wye valley has some of the best adventurous places to offer, including a stone barn near Mitchel Troy village, where there are tree swings and ropes that the children highly enjoy. </p>

                <h3>Dorset, England</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Dorset in England is famous for drawing international tourists to its coastal side.

Also, to the readers of English literature, Dorset is a familiar name, having inspired Thomas Hardy's novels. Dorset has several ports, for example, Poole, and Weymouth, which may be of interest to land-locked tourists. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Weekend getaways at Dorset: the most famous weekend getaway spot at Dorset is perhaps the Yalbury Cottage, a large farmhouse with an eating establishment owned by former Four Seasons chef J. Jones. Other townhouses are plenty in Dorset, The Eastbury being one of the most prominent. </p>

                <h3>York, England</h3>

                <h3>Somerset, England</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Somerset is a more urban location where visitors find the famous city of Bath. But Somerset has a lot more to offer than cityscapes. There are countryside and prestigious international art spaces. Somerset is quite famous for its eateries, some even rival London. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Weekend getaways in Somerset: Staying place in Somerset is not only to the countryside.

Bruton is the ideal place for a pastoral visit, whose premises are divided between a hotel and an excellent restaurant. </p>

                <h3>Kent, England</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">A tour of England is incomplete without visiting Kent, and as a weekend getaway from London, it tops the list owing to its nearness to the country's capital.
