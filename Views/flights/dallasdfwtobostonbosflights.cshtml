            <h2>When to plan your visit to Boston from Dallas? </h2>

            <p class="text-justify">June through October is the ideal time of year to visit Boston. Walking around is a pleasure because of the mild autumnal weather. Furthermore, the sidewalk cafes, baseball games, and outdoor concerts make the summer worthwhile, even though it attracts many tourists and has high hotel costs. Spring is called Boston's shoulder season because of the cold and dry weather. As a result, fewer people visit the city from March to May than in the fall, making this a good time to get reasonable lodging rates. Bring a warm jacket and some boots if you wish to see Beantown covered in snow—or completely submerged in it because winters can be frigid. Another reason to visit in the winter is the possibility of finding a fantastic hotel deal. If you find winter too chilly yet summer and fall hotel prices too high, consider going in the early spring. </p>
