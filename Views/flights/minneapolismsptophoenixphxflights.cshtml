            <h3>When is the Proper Period to Visit Phoenix from Minneapolis?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Phoenix is always a great place to visit, but the best time of year to visit is probably in spring (March through May) and fall (September through November) when temperatures are just right and outdoor activities are blossoming. </li>

                <li>For those sensitive to rates, FaresMatch would recommend booking earlier or travelling during the summer months of June to August when fares drop because air travel is physically inconvenient due to temperature rises in Phoenix.</li>
