            <h2>When to book flights?</h2>
            <p>The cheap flights to Fort Myers can be purchased about a month before the flight if it is a domestic flight and 2-5 months before if it is an international flight. The fare is cheaper when it is mid-week, normally on Tuesday and Wednesday, for most airline companies. Do not book too early or too late because the prices will be higher. Fare alerts & comparison tools to monitor the prices and find out cheap fare deals. </p>
            <p>Also, it is recommended to travel on non-high-demand days, for example, weekdays and during periods that are not considered high travel seasons. The greater the control measures put into the planner and the price monitoring then the higher the chances of grabbing the existing offer. </p>
